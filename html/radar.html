<p>Saying that <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/dell-xps-13-1328971/review">we&apos;re very happy with Dell&apos;s XPS 13</a> is a huge understatement. The slim profile, revolutionary design and small frame bely its powerful performance and gorgeous 13-inch screen. Typically you&apos;d have to weigh up portability and performance, but the XPS 13 has managed to strike a fine balance between the two. With Intel&apos;s latest Kaby Lake processors plus lighting, quick storage and memory, the XPS 13&apos;s starting price is certainly an impressive one. We&apos;re so chuffed with it that it&apos;s still one of our <a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-ultrabook-18-top-thin-and-lights-1054355">favourite Ultrabook</a>, and has taken the top spot as the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/mobile-computing/laptops/windows-8-laptops-release-date-specs-and-prices-1105582">best Windows laptop</a> and the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-laptops-1304361">best overall laptop</a>.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/dell-xps-13-1328971/review">Dell XPS 13</a></p>

<p>Asus has nailed it with the overhauled ZenBook Flip S 2-in-1. Adding top of the line processing power, plenty of memory and a speedy PCle solid state drive available in some of the models, this laptop shows off a beautiful new design to perfection, giving you the ability to use it as a laptop or a tablet. While it costs a pretty penny as compared to some of the competition out there, it would be our top recommendation if money isn&apos;t a factor.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/reviews/asus-zenbook-flip-s-ux370">Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370</a></p>

<p>While this may not be a great leap from the previous generation of MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, the 2018 model is definitely the best Apple has produced to date. The Cupertino firm has ramped up performance for the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2018, more so than the bigger 15-inch model as well. A thin OLED display at the top end of the keyboard can be customised to for various functions, and also offer Touch ID for secure logins. And although it retains Apple&apos;s signature design, it doesn&apos;t come cheap, but you can argue with the choice if you&apos;re a diehard Apple fan.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/macbook-pro-2018-with-touch-bar-13-inch"><u>Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar 13-inch (2018)</u></a></p>

<p>Our earlier choice of gaming laptop, the Asus ROG Zephyrus GX501 has been knocked off its perch by MSI&apos;s GS65 Stealth. With cutting edge components, including an 8th-gen Intel Core i7-8750H processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU, it makes the top spot in gaming laptops. It&apos;s also cheaper than the ROG Zephyrus GX501. And it doesn&apos;t look like a hunky gaming laptop either; with subtle design tweaks, the GS65 Stealth can pass off as a work or study laptop without anyone being none the wiser.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/msi-gs65-stealth">MSI GS65 Stealth</a></p>

<p>Dell&apos;s XPS 15 laptops were already some of the best you could buy, but this beautifully redesigned 15-inch 2-in-1 competes with the Dell XPS 13 in every respect, with the convenience of becoming a tablet when needed. It&apos;s one of the most aesthetically pleasing devices in its category and also boast plenty of power. Under the hood is a new Intel Kaby Lake G-series processor featuring &apos;discreet-class&apos; Radeon graphics &#x2013; meaning with the power comes a bit more noise.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dell-xps-15-2-in-1">Dell XPS 15 2-in-1</a>&#xA0;</p>

      <description>Research from Google on its Password Checkup Chrome extension has found many users rely on unsafe login details.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early this year, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/news/google-boosts-password-security-with-password-checkup-chrome-extension?region-switch=1565914955"><u>Google introduced the Password Checkup extension</u></a> to its Chrome web browser, enabling users to automatically detect if the login details used online have been compromised.</p><p>New <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/08/new-research-lessons-from-password.html" target="_blank"><u>research</u></a> from the tech giant has found that, in just the first month of the extension operating, 1.5% of the users (316,000) that installed and used the extension were using logins known to be unsafe &#x2013;&#xA0;but Google is looking to change that.</p><p>When you take into consideration the billions of users that <em>didn&#x2019;t </em>install the extension, and the likelihood that their login details are compromised as those that did, this is a rather alarming figure.</p>
<ul ><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/news/google-boosts-password-security-with-password-checkup-chrome-extension?region-switch=1565914955"><u>Google boosts password security with Password Checkup Chrome extension</u></a></li></ul>
<h3>Regular checkups</h3>
<p>The Password Checkup extension works by notifying users if they try signing into any website &#x201C;using one of over 4 billion usernames and passwords that Google knows to be unsafe due to a third-party data breach&#x201D;.</p><p>Both the checking of user login details, and the cross-referencing with the database of compromised details utilizes encryption to ensure that no information is stored locally or remotely with Google.</p><p>Currently, users wishing to use this feature will need to install the extension themselves and opt-in, and the functionality is limited to platforms that support extensions at all (Chrome for Android doesn&#x2019;t, for instance).</p><p>However, as discovered by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/08/15/google-password-checkup-leak-detection-will-soon-be-built-into-chrome/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the Chromium Bug Tracker is showing evidence that Google will integrate this feature into Chrome directly (specifically, in October&#x2019;s release of Chrome 78), allowing it to become available by default to many more users.</p><p>Chrome, though, isn&apos;t the first browser to boast a tool like this. A <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/news/firefox-monitor-will-notify-you-if-your-passwords-have-been-compromised"><u>similar feature (Monitor) already exists in Mozilla&#x2019;s Firefox</u></a> web browser, in partnership with the website and database HaveIBeenPwned, and it was recently discovered that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/news/firefox-will-soon-alert-users-if-their-saved-passwords-have-been-breached"><u>improved integration with Monitor and the browser&#x2019;s password manager</u></a> will roll out in a future release.</p>

      <title>Kogan's flogging a 55-inch QLED TV for just $800</title>

      <description>Kogan's new 4K QLED TV is the most affordable option available on the Australian market right now.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting yourself a brand-new television set that boasts <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/news/samsung-qled-samsungs-latest-television-acronym-explained">QLED technology</a> means you&apos;ll need to shell out at least a couple of thousand dollars, if not more. And bigger the panel, the heftier the price tag.</p><p>Kogan, however, has just debuted its own QLED smart TV at just a fraction of the cost to help &quot;Aussies save thousands of dollars&quot;. The company&apos;s new <a href="https://www.getprice.com.au/prodhits.aspx?pid=410528568&amp;shopid=932&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2forigin.getprice.com.au%2fcompareproducts.aspx%3fid%3d170277&amp;page=%2fkogan-ru8510-55inch-qled-tv.htm&amp;pagetype=&amp;categorytype=&amp;hasfeaturedad=no&amp;cid=66931937.1554180112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>55-inch QLED TV is up for pre-order for just $799.99</strong></a> &#x2013; making it the most affordable QLED TV available in Australia right now &#x2013; and will begin shipping out to customers on August 30.</p><p>Although this is just the pre-sale price, Kogan is throwing in free shipping to sweeten the deal. The offer expires August 30, after which the price will go up by $100 to $899.99. While this is still pretty cheap for a QLED TV, click on the green button below if you want to save a massive bundle on a brand-new 4K telly.</p>
<h3>Feature-packed</h3>
<p>Despite the low price point, Kogan&apos;s new QLED TV boasts a 4K UltraHD almost bezel-less display with 3,840 &#xD7; 2,160 resolution at 60Hz.</p><p>Quantum dot is the same technology that&apos;s used in several popular television sets, including those from Samsung and LG, and ensures picture quality is crisp, with vivid colour reproduction and intense contrasts.&#xA0;</p><p>While the new Kogan QLED TV promises excellent image quality, it&apos;s important to note that you&apos;re likely just paying for the display panel. It would be wrong to compare the performance of the Kogan TV with the likes of Samsung, as the user interface and the processing power will vary greatly.</p><p>Yet, the new 55-inch Kogan QLED TV comes equipped with apps for streaming Netflix, YouTube and all the free-to-air channels, and runs on the Linux Smart operating system. The remote also comes with YouTube and Netflix buttons for quick access to your favourite streaming sites.</p><p>On the back of the telly are six ports &#x2013; four HDMI and two USB &#x2013; alongside Wi-Fi and LAN connectivity.&#xA0;</p><p>All that for under $800 is a steal!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new iPhone 11 launch date is looking stronger than ever, and we&apos;re starting to see some real, solid leaks on how the upgraded handset will look.</p><p>If you&apos;re not up to speed with what the iPhone 2019 rumor mill is spilling forth, then you&apos;d best get ready for a slight disappointment: the new iPhone range looks set to be nothing more than an incremental upgrade. We&apos;ve got some heritage in sifting through these rumors - we&apos;ve been at it for over a decade - and nothing we&apos;ve picked up suggests anything more than that.</p><p>What does that mean? Well, a similar shape and size to previous launches (with three phones mooted for unveiling at the new iPhone 11 launch) but they won&apos;t bring amazing changes just now.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in what&apos;s coming next, then we&apos;re predicting 5G, the Lightning connector being dropped and <em>possibly</em> even a foldable phone - but either way, that won&apos;t be happening until we see the next iPhone in 2020 at the very least.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/two-massive-iphone-11-leaks-spill-the-beans-on-apples-upcoming-phones"><em>The new iPhone 11 range looks likely to support a new rainbow colorway</em></a><em> - which would be a first for the brand - and </em><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-likely-launch-date-is-found-buried-within-ios-13-beta-code"><em>we think we may have got wind of the iPhone 11 launch date</em></a><em>... and it&apos;s very much as we expected.</em></p><p>Will we get the iPhone 11 &apos;Pro&apos; this year?

<p>The main change will be that camera upgrade - we&apos;re now fully expecting three sensors on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max, and just two on the iPhone 11R - but with enhanced capabilities on each model.</p><p>What is of more interest is whether Apple will be pushing the iPhone 11R (if it indeed it does call it that) <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">as that&apos;s the phone that&apos;s most prominently featured on its homepage</a> - suggesting the cheaper phone could almost be the star of the show this year.</p><p>There will reportedly be some smart features added for charging, and Apple might finally have added in something users have been crying out for - read on to find out the full rundown of what TechRadar&apos;s iPhone experts expect to see for the new iPhone in 2019.</p><p><em>We&apos;ve rounded the key iPhone 11 leaks in a little video just for you, to give a quick overview of what you may be able to expect later this year.&#xA0;</em></p>
<h3>New iPhone 11 release date</h3>
<p>Like every year, we&apos;ve been doing some sleuthing around the possible iPhone 11 release date, and we think we&apos;ve got a pretty good idea around what&apos;s coming:</p>
<ul ><li><strong>iPhone 11 launch date: September 10, 2019</strong>&#xA0;</li><li><strong>iPhone 11 pre-order date: September 13, 2019</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 11 release date: September 20, 2019</strong></li></ul>
<p>Apple hasn&apos;t held its phone event on a Monday for years, with Tuesday or Wednesday the most commonly used days.&#xA0;</p><p>With the Wednesday being September 11, a day of mourning in the US that it&apos;s traditionally avoided, <strong>Apple will most likely pick an iPhone 11 launch date of Tuesday, September 10, 2019</strong>.</p><p>Now, leaks from experienced phone-sleuther @evleaks suggested <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-11-galaxy-note-10-and-pixel-4-release-dates-leaked">a roadmap of key phone launches</a> coming later, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-likely-launch-date-is-found-buried-within-ios-13-beta-code">but source code buried within the new iOS 13 beta release seems to confirm the iPhone 11 unveiling as Tuesday September 10.</a></p><p>Apple hasn&apos;t launched an iPhone this late since 2011, when it announced the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-4s-1031754/review">iPhone 4S</a> on October 4, and this new information corroborates the same yearly cycle.</p><p>This date allows Apple to ship its iPhones into retail channels well before the holiday rush, and is now a well-trodden path to do such. As for the new iPhone 11 pre-order date, Apple tends to open this on the Friday following the launch, which would be September 13 by our calculations.</p><p>Finally, the new iPhone 11 release date - the day when you&apos;ll actually be able to get your hands on the handset for the first time - seems very likely to be a week later on Friday September 20, if previous releases are anything to go by.</p><p>That prediction was bolsted by <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/13/iphone-11-pro-release-date-set-for-mid-september-alongside-iphone-11/">an analyst from Wedbush claiming that the three new iPhones launched in 2019 will all go on sale at the same time</a> - the iPhone 11, 11 Max and 11R would all be on sale at the same time thanks to the production process being so much more mature this year - again, suggesting little in the way of upgrades.</p><p>And it might not be just the new iPhone range that launches on this date, we may well also get the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/apple-watch-5-what-we-want-to-see">Apple Watch 5</a> then too.</p>
<h3>New iPhone 11 price: will it still be $1,000?</h3>
<ul ><li><strong>iPhone 11 price likely to start around $999 (&#xA3;999, AU$1,579)</strong></li><li><strong>There could be a new price strategy</strong></li></ul>
<p>The iPhone 11 price is almost certain not to drop this year - especially for the &apos;main&apos; new iPhone. After all, Apple priced both the iPhone XS and iPhone X starting at $999 (&#xA3;999, AU$1,579) and without a massive change to the design or functionality, a price hike doesn&apos;t seem likely.</p><p>With news that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-iphone-revenue-shortfall-2019">Apple isn&apos;t selling as many iPhones</a> as it previously forecast, there&apos;s a chance the iPhone 11 will be priced more affordably - although we reckon a price freeze, rather than a reduction, is a more likely move by Apple.</p><p>That said, the new iPhone 11R could be a touch cheaper - depending on the new camera technology. A less-costly iPhone than last year (where the iPhone XR debuted for $749 / $749) could happen if not a lot changes to the hardware... but if Apple goes with the higher-power camera, then the same price is likely to be maintained, in our opinion.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-next-super-sized-iphone-could-be-called-the-iphone-11-pro">The addition of the iPhone 11 Pro rumor</a> - which, it has to be noted, is based on a single tweet (one that<em> does </em>have some form in getting the naming right of past iPhones) - would suggest a price hike for the phones.</p><p>But given <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/iphone-11-will-lack-novelty-for-consumers-says-an-analyst-in-japans-mizuho-securities-6817301.html">analysts are suggesting that the new phones will &apos;lack novelty&apos;</a>, we&apos;re not expecting the inflated cost that would bring.</p>
<h3>New iPhone, iPhone 11 or iPhone XI?</h3>
<p>What will Apple call the iPhone 2019? It&apos;s a tricky one: Apple has backed itself into a corner with the name. Roman numerals could well remain, but how does the iPhone XI follow the iPhone XS?&#xA0;</p><p>Apple has been staunch on verbally calling the handsets the &apos;iPhone 10&apos; and &apos;iPhone 10-S&apos;. With that in mind, the iPhone XI seems to make the most sense, but then - if the older models remain - there will be an X, an XS and an XI (along with an XR) - and iPhone 11 is easier to understand.</p>
<figure><p><img  id="p6c8cxtQdbQxaHdY699vpW" name="" alt="New iPhone 11" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p6c8cxtQdbQxaHdY699vpW.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>The iPhone XS and XS Max are great, but there's still room for improvement</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>That doesn&apos;t easily point to the best, most-desirable model. So could Apple do what&apos;s been rumored for years and simply go for the &apos;new iPhone&apos; as the &apos;main&apos; XS replacement, and stick with the same iPhone XR name, albeit with a small spec upgrade?</p><p>As mentioned, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-next-super-sized-iphone-could-be-called-the-iphone-11-pro">the iPhone Pro</a> could be added to the mix, bringing it into line with its iPads (and indeed MacBooks) in terms of their naming, but we&apos;re rather doubtful of that.</p><p>That said, we&apos;ve now seen the names &apos;iPhone 11&apos;, &apos;iPhone 11 Pro&apos; and &apos;iPhone 11 Pro Max&apos; <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-line-up-may-feature-11-pro-and-11-pro-max-but-probably-wont-be-called-that">listed by a case-maker</a>, so we can&apos;t rule out the &apos;Pro&apos; moniker. iPhone 11 Pro Max seems very unlikely though.</p><p>But Apple has already ditched numbered increments for Mac, MacBooks, TV and iPads, so &apos;new iPhone&apos; would be a logical next step - even if iPhone 11 would be the most pleasing thing for consumers looking for the obviously best new phone.</p>
<h3>New iPhone 11 design</h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pVbIc5YoAE"></iframe>
<p>What will the new iPhone look like? Pretty simple really: from the front, quite similar (according to the leaks we&apos;ve seen). The biggest change will be on the back: a hefty triple-lens camera in a square design.</p><p>We&apos;ve included a video from Mobile Fun above, one that shows the best rendering of what most are expecting to see from the iPhone 11 when it launches later this year.</p><p>That design <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-11-renders-show-off-a-triple-lens-camera">shows up in most leaks</a> we&apos;re seeing at the moment, with the three camera system being used on the iPhone 11 and 11 Max, with the iPhone 11R still getting the large square bump, but only two lenses.</p><p>The square protrusion doesn&apos;t look as attractive as we&apos;re used to seeing on iPhones, but Apple could be springing a surprise to make sure it doesn&apos;t lose too much ground to Samsung, Huawei and Google.</p><p>We&apos;ve seen huge improvements to the camera quality there, and while Apple&apos;s iPhones are still superb at taking pictures on the go, extra capability like a wide-angle lens would be something extra and would explain the extra size of the sensors.</p>
<p>A leaker took a reported photo of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/samsung-galaxy-note-10-what-we-want-to-see">Galaxy Note 10 Plus</a> - but did it with a phone that looked suspiciously like the iPhone 11R, with the double (rather than triple) lens array, according to the placement of the flash.</p><p>Whether both are real is up for debate (the quality of the snap isn&apos;t great, and you&apos;d expect better from Apple, even at this early development stage) it shows in the real world what the design could be like.</p>
<figure><p><img  id="8xDeUWY3DmensPiiBjwCvB" name="" alt="New iPhone 11" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8xDeUWY3DmensPiiBjwCvB.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>iPhone 11 case dummies (credit: SlashLeaks)</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of the triple-lens camera, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/leaked-case-dummies-give-us-another-look-at-the-iphone-11-models">that&apos;s on show with the dummies leaked above</a> - again, not confirmed but matching what we&apos;ve heard so far - giving us an early look at the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max.</p>
<p>Speaking of the iPhone 11R, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-xr-2-could-come-in-two-new-colors">reports suggest</a> that the new phone will be landing in purple and green shades - in addition to the current range of black, white, yellow and red - with coral and blue disappearing after shards of the new material appeared.</p><p>These were leaked by respected Apple writer Mark Gurman, who also showed the new iPhone range will have this larger camera protrusion in new case moldings, used by third-party manufacturers to secure your iPhone.</p>
<p>We&apos;ve <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/two-massive-iphone-11-leaks-spill-the-beans-on-apples-upcoming-phones">elsewhere heard</a> that all three new iPhones might come in black, white, gold and dark green shades, while one source adds that some models might have a subtle &apos;rainbow&apos; finish.</p><p>Another leak from <a href="https://cashkaro.com/blog/exclusive-iphone-xi-renders-video/106205" target="_blank">CashKaro</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1121671490078797824" target="_blank">OnLeaks</a>, suggest the new iPhones will get a smaller (and more circular) mute button, but that&apos;s hardly going to raise the roof when the new iPhone 11 is announced on stage in September.</p><p>Rumors of a frosted-glass back do appear once in a while, but (at best) this is likely to be a small variant and not indicative of the wider iPhone 11&apos;s design style - even if it would help improve wireless charging.</p>

<h3>New iPhone 11 display: the same or shifting?</h3>
<p>Right: let&apos;s get one thing straight... there&apos;s not going to be a flexible iPhone this year. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/apple-patents-show-possible-forms-of-foldable-iphone-or-ipad">While we&apos;ve seen patents so far</a>, that&apos;s as far as the rumor mill is cranking about a bendy Apple device - and that makes sense, given how many issues Samsung and Huawei have had with their bending handsets.</p><p>So what will the iPhone 11 display look like? Well, the smart money is <em>currently</em> saying that things will remain the same. A <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-cyclops-rear-camera-rumor-gets-another-boost">rumor has stated</a> that the 5.8-inch display will remain, with the bezels will shrinking slightly, although that was an added line to a wider &apos;leak&apos; that the iPhone will have a central camera - which we don&apos;t think will happen.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/after-the-iphone-11-apples-phones-could-get-a-lot-smaller">some reports say the display size will stay the same size</a>, others think the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-iphone-11-could-be-bigger-than-the-iphone-xs">main iPhone 11 will be larger</a>. We believe that the same 5.8-inch screen will remain on the iPhone 11 - as that will be cheaper for Apple to produce than making a whole new size.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>"Don't get your hopes for up a foldable new iPhone, or even a 5G iPhone, in 2019 - Apple is likely to play things safely this year, doubling down on the iPhone X form factor from 2017."</p><figcaption><cite>John McCann - deputy editor</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>Another way to save the cost would be to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-may-ditch-3d-touch-for-cheaper-alternative">drop the 3D Touch element of the screen</a>, according to investment bank Barclays (who claim to have spent time with the Asia supply chain) where one can press harder to open up a new menu. That would be replaced by a more powerful haptic engine that would do... something.&#xA0;</p><p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/23/iphone-11-models-camera-processor/">According to 9to5Mac</a>, this is known internally as &apos;leap haptics&apos; and the source code of iOS 13 hints at Haptic Touch, which would replace the smart 3D Touch menus that pop up.</p><p>The same confusion over screen size doesn&apos;t seem to reign for the iPhone 11 Max screen, with some suggesting the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/if-youre-expecting-the-iphone-11-to-revolutionize-phones-you-may-be-disappointed">same-sized display</a> as the iPhone XS Max (at 6.5 inches), but fans will have to wait until 2020 before Apple will <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apples-2020-iphone-xs-max-equivalent-set-to-have-an-even-larger-display">increase it to </a><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apples-2020-iphone-xs-max-equivalent-set-to-have-an-even-larger-display">a siza</a><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apples-2020-iphone-xs-max-equivalent-set-to-have-an-even-larger-display">ble 6.7 inches</a>.</p><p>The best leaks also suggest that Apple will stick with an OLED display for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max, with the same (cheaper) LCD screen for the new 11R, which would help keep the cost down and preserve battery life. Though one source adds that the LCD screen on the iPhone 11R will see some improvements, such as better anti-aliasing.</p>
<h3>New iPhone 11 camera: the biggest change</h3>
<p>As we&apos;ve heavily discussed already, unless <em>all </em>the leaks are fake, the iPhone 11 camera looks pretty likely to pack a larger, more square lens array on the rear of the device.</p><p>This is the only real hardware upgrade we&apos;re seeing from Apple this year, with 2019&apos;s iPhone coming with enhanced picture-taking capabilities. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/leaked-iphone-11-schematics-seem-to-support-square-triple-camera-design">Schematics</a> suggest the same thing, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/a-triple-lens-iphone-11-is-looking-ever-more-likely">most chassis leaks</a> hint at the same square cut-out portion. &#xA0;</p><p>Respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has weighed in to say that one of these lenses might be almost invisible, adding <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-reportedly-planning-big-upgrades-to-the-cameras-on-the-iphone-11">at the same time</a> that the selfie camera will get a boost from 7MP to 12MP.</p>
<figure><p><img  id="nXrGsyJGVXkt3zGTS3WrYg" name="" alt="New iPhone 11" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nXrGsyJGVXkt3zGTS3WrYg.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>Image Credit: Weibo</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-11-max-rumored-to-have-a-triple-lens-camera">One source</a> claims that <strong>only</strong> the iPhone 11 Max will have the three camera array, but that seems rather fanciful when Apple made a big deal in 2018 explaining how the iPhone XS and XS Max were almost identical bar the screen size - we expect three lenses on both the higher-end 11 variants.</p><p>What will those lenses be? Well, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-camera-software-and-design-details-leaked">smart money suggests</a> that there will be three 12MP lenses: one that takes &apos;standard&apos; photos (with decent low-light capabilities), the zoom lens and a new wide-angle option opening up a new world of photography capabilities.</p><p>That source is suggesting that the third lens on the iPhone 11 won&apos;t have optical image stabilization, which would be an interesting move, and that the flash will be even brighter and more useful.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>"The latest leaks and rumors suggest we'll be seeing significant upgrades for the main camera, to help it beat the some of the greatest Android phones such as the Google Pixel 3 and Huawei P30 Pro".</p><figcaption><cite>James Peckham - phones editor</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The same source <em>also</em> is stating that the image processor inside will be enhanced, but we&apos;d expect nothing less from a brand that&apos;s likely to push the camera prowess as the main reason to buy the new iPhone range.&#xA0;</p><p>Apple&apos;s Neural Engine did bring some impressive boosts to the photo quality of the iPhone XS, so another jump forward could continue the brand&apos;s ability to just take photos that, well, look nice - thanks to intelligent algorithms working out what they&apos;re looking at.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-11-camera-leak-smart-frame">Smart Frame capabilities</a> would add a better way to improve the snaps you&apos;re about to take, but we&apos;re still mostly in the dark about what that would bring at the moment.</p><p>Elsewhere, we&apos;ve <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/two-massive-iphone-11-leaks-spill-the-beans-on-apples-upcoming-phones">heard</a> that the iPhone 11 could use &apos;new&apos; 12MP sensors, and will offer improved photography, with the three lenses apparently working in coordination in an RGB mode. One of the lenses is also said to offer a 120-degree field-of-view.</p><p>What about the front camera? Well, there we&apos;re going to get a 10MP sensor upgraded (<a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-11-rumor-hints-at-a-10mp-selfie-camera-but-no-usb-c-port">apparently</a>) - but the same suggests that the new iPhone 11 will have 14MP and 10MP sensors on the rear, which seems unlikely. Even still, an upgrade to selfies would be a welcome addition.</p><p>A laser-powered 3D camera was supposedly destined for the new iPhone 11, that looks more like we&apos;ll see it on the iPhone for 2020, in a bid to really show off the new iPhone&apos;s augmented reality (AR) capabilities.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Sadly, the notch looks like it&apos;ll be staying the same size - even though the camera tech is shrinking down, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-camera-software-and-design-details-leaked">a source says</a> the notch is staying the same this year. This aligns with rumors that the phone chassis isn&apos;t moving in size, so does make sense.</p>
<h3>New iPhone 11 battery and features</h3>
<p>The iPhone 11 battery was always going to be a source of much debate, with users asking every year for a little more juice coming out of their device. The good news for them is that a couple of nifty tricks might helps things along for the new iPhone in 2019.</p><p>One thing we&apos;re <em>not</em> expecting is that the new iPhone will lose the Lightning connector, the Apple-only port that connects to all manner of accessories. Multiple rumors have stated that it might be replaced by USB-C, but it seems (for now) that won&apos;t be the case.</p><p>We&apos;ve now heard <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-reportedly-not-getting-a-fast-charging-upgrade">multiple times</a> that it won&apos;t get USB-C, so don&apos;t expect a guaranteed change from Lightning - even though it might have improved the speed with which the iPhone could charge.</p><p>That said, we could see a compromise here: <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/latest-iphone-11-leak-says-the-next-iphone-xr-is-getting-a-camera-bump">Apple might <em>finally</em> bundle in the 18W charging block that would see the iPhone charge more quickly</a>. The catch: the USB-A end (the connector most of us think of when imagining a USB lead) would be dropped for a smaller USB-C, allowing for speedier juicing.</p><p>Having that in the box would be a nice addition to the wireless charging that&apos;s almost certain to continue. That wireless charging would go two ways, meaning you&apos;ll be able to throw the AirPods, in a wireless charging case, onto the back of the iPhone 11 and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/next-iphone-may-be-able-to-boost-other-devices-with-two-way-wireless-charging">be able to charge them up on the go</a>.</p><p>What about that battery pack? Well, noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the iPhone 11 will have a battery that&apos;s up to 25% bigger than the current iPhone XS (to allow for this dual-charging) without destroying the battery life in a single day.</p><p>Huawei and Samsung phones already pack this feature and it&apos;s been well-marketed as a key selling point - so it makes sense that Apple would want to bring things too.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>"The iPhone 11 may not look very different, but the new triple-lens camera is poised to offer a serious upgrade that could rival more-capable Android phone."</p><figcaption><cite>Matt Swider - global managing editor</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The iPhone 11 Max might not get <em>as</em> much of an upgrade, but 15% would still be a large jump forward compared to the current Max device - and without the device getting thicker, thanks to possible upgrades in the screen tech.&#xA0;</p><p>Having said though, elsewhere <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/two-massive-iphone-11-leaks-spill-the-beans-on-apples-upcoming-phones">we&apos;ve heard</a> that the iPhone 11 Max will have a 3,969mAh battery, which would be quite an upgrade. However, the same source says that charging will still be stuck at a slow 5W.</p><p>What about some other smaller features? Well, another upgrade is that, according to one <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-camera-software-and-design-details-leaked">source</a> at least, Face ID will be improved for the new iPhone 11 range, allowing it to work from wider angles.</p><p>Apple always introduces a new chipset with its new iPhone launches, and the A13 chip is being touted for the iPhone 11, with analysts claiming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/23/tsmc-a13-chip-orders/">a manufacturer is already lined up to produce the chip</a>. After Apple made a huge deal about the AI learning capabilities of the A12 Bionic chip, one has to assume the big changes to the new chipset are going to be a big talking point come September this year.</p><p>As for storage, one source says the range will offer 128GB, 256GB and 512GB capacities, while another points to 64GB, 256GB and 512GB. Either way, 1TB is looking unlikely.</p><p>Let&apos;s move onto the more experimental features that <em>may (</em>read: mostly patents and leaks of things that could be possible in smartphones) be seen in the new iPhone 11 - but we think they&apos;re pretty unlikely.</p><p>For one: the new iPhones may be easier to use in the rain. A <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/your-iphone-11s-display-may-work-underwater"><u>report claims</u></a> Apple is experimenting with a new tech that allows you to use the phone&apos;s screen underwater.</p>

<p>What&apos;s more, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-could-have-a-camera-designed-for-underwater-photography"><u>a patent</u></a> suggests the camera on a future iPhone would be able to tell when you&apos;re underwater and alter settings accordingly, so that underwater photographs look better.</p><p>Perhaps <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-iphone-11-could-scan-the-veins-in-your-face-to-unlock"><u>the iPhone 11 could have sub-epidermal scanning</u></a> to be unlocked, in which the front camera would scan the veins and blood vessels in your face using IR to make sure it&apos;s actually you unlocking the phone.</p><p>These blood pathways in your face are the most secure way of monitoring who you are - and can&apos;t be fooled in the same way as Face ID theoretically can be.</p><p>Another patent meanwhile <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-iphone-11-could-bring-back-touch-id-with-a-huge-twist">points to the return of Touch ID</a>, but not as you know it. Rather, the patent talks about a system that would recognize your fingerprint when placed anywhere on the screen.</p><p>So it would be an in-screen scanner that works across the whole display, though we&apos;re not convinced Apple will actually use this - lots of weird and wonderful things get patented with nothing coming of them.</p><p>For something else a little bit weird, a patent filed by Apple shows <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-iphone-11-or-apple-watch-5-could-monitor-your-body-smells"><u>a system in which a sensor monitors chemicals in the air</u></a>, in order to &apos;smell&apos; odors &#x2013; including body odor. That would be a pretty cool feature for the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/apple-watch-5-what-we-want-to-see"><u>Apple Watch 5</u></a> rather than an iPhone, though.</p><p>Inside the device <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-11-tipped-to-have-faster-wi-fi-but-5g-might-have-to-wait"><u>we&apos;ve heard talk</u></a> that the iPhone 11 will include support for the latest Wi-Fi 6 connection standards &#x2013; though 5G tech will have to wait until the 2020 iPhones.</p><p>One out there rumor on the iPhone 11 is <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-could-come-with-a-huge-new-feature-apple-pencil-support">that it could be compatible with the Apple Pencil</a> - but we&apos;ve heard that a number of times and we&apos;re not going to be drawn in to believing such a thing this year - especially not the size of the Apple Pencil we&apos;re seeing right now, which would be be bigger than any iPhone device.</p><p>That said, it could be charged on the new wireless charging rear of the new iPhone - so that does make things seem a touch more believable.</p>
<h3>New iPhone 11: what we want to see</h3>
<p>We were mostly impressed with the new iPhones last year, but that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re perfect - talk to any ardent Android user and they&apos;ll give chapter and verse why the iPhone isn&apos;t anywhere near as well-specified as their device.</p><p>That does kind of miss the point of the iPhone - Apple&apos;s never been about the spec, more the usability and overall polish - but there are some things we&apos;d like to see more (or less) of with the iPhone 11 range:&#xA0;</p>
<h3>1. No notch (or, at least, a smaller one)</h3>
<p>The iPhone X made the smartphone notch a mainstream &apos;thing&apos; - but with the advent of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/are-pop-up-cameras-here-to-stay-on-our-smartphones">punch-hole cameras and under-screen technology</a> on our phones, the notch needs to go.&#xA0;</p><p>While Apple needs that space to chuck in the array of sensors that make Face ID as secure as it is, we want a new solution - and Apple has the means to work out what that is, as well as helping attract a new raft of users.</p>
<figure><p><img  id="qxnwcLh8owK5LfvzqDFnec" name="" alt="New iPhone 11" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qxnwcLh8owK5LfvzqDFnec.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>The notch is big... imagine if it wasn't there on the new iPhone</p></figcaption></figure>
<h3>2. A new design</h3>
<p>While the current design of the iPhone XS and XS Max is one of the best out there, we want something new, something more. Apple could make things more sleek, remove more of the physical buttons or even wrap the screen around - a statement can be made with some smart engineering.</p><p>Sadly, that doesn&apos;t seem likely to appear until 2020&apos;s iPhone - the new iPhone in 2019 looks destined to stay rather similar to the last two generations&apos; design.</p>
<h3>3. Better battery life</h3>
<p>We say this ever year, but the fact remains that iPhones still aren&apos;t the strongest performers when it comes to battery life.</p><p>That said, the iPhone XR was one of the longest-lasting devices ever from the Cupertino brand, so let&apos;s see some of the prowess baked into the larger, more expensive iPhones. It&apos;s not easy (damned physics keeps getting in the way) but that doesn&apos;t mean improvements can&apos;t be made.</p>
<h3>4. eSIM only</h3>
<p>The current iPhones - the XS, XS Max and iPhone XR - all pack an eSim alongside their main, physical card.&#xA0;</p><p>While it would be weird at first, Apple has the power to change users&apos; attitudes to what&apos;s acceptable on a smartphone (think how everyone is now losing the headphone jack) and making the SIM virtual would allow greater freedom to hop between networks and deals at will, rather than being stuck on one contract for too long.&#xA0;</p><p>With 5G on the way, that&apos;s going to see a lot more competition for users - and flexibility will be the number one benefit for those wanting a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/deals/mobile-phone-deals">great phone deal</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>iPhone 11 (likely) launch date is found buried within iOS 13 beta code</title>

      <description>Some sleuthing in the new iOS beta 13 release has turned up some surprising information</description>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 21:09:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <source url="http://www.techradar.com">techradar.com</source>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ready for the next round of iPhones? The new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-xi">iPhone 11</a> launch looks like it&apos;s been outed - and it&apos;s exactly as we predicted.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/ios-13-features">iOS 13</a> beta 7 lands for the public today, developers have been hard at work finding out what&apos;s hidden inside. While we haven&apos;t cracked through it yet, <a href="https://ihelpbr.com/arquivos-internos-do-ios-13-corroboram-lancamento-de-novo-iphone-no-dia-10-de-setembro/" target="_blank">iHelpBR</a> has found something revealing about the new iPhone.</p><p>Located deep inside the code is a placeholder called &apos;HoldForRelease&apos; - showing a homepage image with the calendar icon showing Tuesday, September 10.</p><p>That&apos;s exactly the date we predicted for the iPhone 11 launch, fitting in perfectly with what we&apos;ve seen rumored already and fitting with the previous launch cycle Apple has adhered to.</p>
<p>iHelpBR pointed out that the same placeholder image was used last year in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/ios-12">iOS 12</a> to show when the phone would be launched, displaying Wednesday September 12 (which turned out to be accurate), so we&apos;re pretty confident the same will be happening this year.</p><p>So, if you&apos;re interested in finding all about the new iPhone as it launches, make sure you&apos;re not doing anything on September 10 - it&apos;ll be an iJamboree across the tech sphere.</p>
<h3>But what will we see?</h3>
<p>Now, here&apos;s the tricky bit. What will actually be shown on stage might seem obvious but there are a number of different things conflicting about <em>what</em> will be unveiled on September 10.</p><p>We&apos;re almost certain we&apos;ll see a refresh of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/iphone-xs-review">iPhone XS</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/iphone-xs-review">iPhone XS Max</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/iphone-xr-review">iPhone XR</a> - but what they&apos;ll be called is up for debate.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-11-line-up-may-feature-11-pro-and-11-pro-max-but-probably-wont-be-called-that">Current theory - based on a tweet and a case manufacturer&apos;s placeholder entry for the new phones</a> - suggests that we&apos;ll get an iPhone 11 (replacing the 11R), and an iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max to sit in place of the XS and XS Max.</p>
<figure><p><img  id="4PV7cyzvWN7oyB4QSFohKK" name="" alt="New iPhone" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4PV7cyzvWN7oyB4QSFohKK.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>The new iPhone is set to look rather similar</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>This seems unlikely for a couple of reasons: firstly, Apple doesn&apos;t seem to be adding enough to the new phones for the name &apos;pro&apos; to be appended. Were that to happen, we&apos;d expect larger screen sizes, more power and ways to connect a greater number of accessories - things we&apos;ve not seen a lot of so far in the leaks.</p><p>Equally, the iPhone 11 Pro Max seems an incredibly clunky name - Apple&apos;s already teetering on the edge with things like the iPhone XS Max, so throwing a &apos;Pro&apos; moniker in there simply doesn&apos;t scan for a brand that revels in beauty so much.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/two-massive-iphone-11-leaks-spill-the-beans-on-apples-upcoming-phones">What <em>does </em>seem likely is that we&apos;ll get an upgraded battery, and there could be a rainbow, shimmering color to bring a new flavor to the iPhone range.</a></p><p>Apple will be hoping this - along with the much-vaunted triple rear camera - will be enough for consumers to consider it more than just a mild upgrade, which is what many analysts are starting to predict.</p><p>TechRadar will be bringing you total coverage of the new iPhone launch as ever, so make sure you <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-xi">bookmark our roundup page</a> to get all the info as it happens.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the market for the best 13-inch laptop your bank account can afford? Well, you&#x2019;ve come to the right spot.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not easy trying to get by without one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-laptops-1304361"><u>best laptops</u></a> these days, as they&#x2019;re essential for so many reasons. There&#x2019;s only one real reason, however, to go for one of the top 13-inch laptops: they&#x2019;re just the perfect size. 15-inch laptops are too large, while anything less than 12-inches will have you squinting.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The best 13-inch laptops, however, hit that sweet, space-saving spot. They&#x2019;re ideal for getting your work done, as well as enjoying movies on Netflix at the end of the day.</p><p>Choosing one of the top 13-inch laptops for you will depend on your individual preference and needs. Do you want a simple and straightforward laptop, or are you partial to one with all the fancy bells and whistles? Do you need a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-2-in-1-laptops-top-5-hybrid-laptops-reviewed-1258451">2-in-1 laptop</a> that can turn into one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/windows-8-tablets-release-date-specs-and-prices-916134">best Windows tablets</a> with just a flip of the display? Or do you want to skip <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review">Windows 10</a> entirely, and opt for one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/mac-buyer-s-guide-2015-1295725">best Macs</a>, backed up by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/macos-1014">macOS Mojave</a> (or soon, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/macos-catalina">macOS Catalina</a>).</p><p>There are a few excellent 13-inch laptops to choose from. Whatever your needs are, you&#x2019;ll find the ideal match on this list.</p>
<figure><p><img  id="g4Z6kKpACSX2SyWb47m6A7" name="" alt="Huawei MateBook 13" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g4Z6kKpACSX2SyWb47m6A7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>Image Credit: TechRadar</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#x2019;s not often that we find a 13-inch laptop that ticks all the right boxes, especially one that doesn&#x2019;t compromise on anything. The Huawei MateBook 13 is one of those very few devices. Rocking the latest Intel Whiskey Lake processors and Nvidia MX150 graphics in a chassis that really should be too small to fit them all in, the Huawei MateBook 13 is a powerful machine that can easily slip into most backpacks or medium-sized tote bags. Even better for users who cannot afford to splurge, it&#x2019;s budget-friendly. What more could you ask for?</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-matebook-13">Huawei MateBook 13</a> &#xA0;</p>

<p>While its changes over last year&#x2019;s model are subtle, there&#x2019;s no doubt that the Dell XPS 13 is still one of the best 13-inch laptops money can buy. On the high end, the 4K display delivers a sharper picture across the board. Even if you can&#x2019;t afford the highest end model, the dashing design, long battery life and SD card slot aren&#x2019;t going anywhere. More importantly, you&#x2019;ve got a quad-core processor regardless of configuration you end up with. The Dell XPS 13 is, without a doubt, one of the best 13-inch laptops right now.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/dell-xps-13-1328971/review">Dell XPS 13</a></p>

<p>One look at the HP Spectre x360, and you&#x2019;ll be hard-pressed to argue that it&#x2019;s one of the most beautiful laptops on the market today. That gem-cut build means it&#x2019;ll get your work done in style. It&#x2019;s not all skin-deep, however. This stunning 13-inch laptop is packed with the latest Intel hardware as well, so you know it can get your work done. And, if that&#x2019;s not enough, it can also be flipped around into tablet mode. The HP Spectre x360 really is one of the best 13-inch laptops out there.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hp-spectre-x360-2016">HP Spectre x360</a></p>

<p>While the 13-inch version isn&#x2019;t the most powerful Surface Book 2 right now, it still makes for one of the best 13-inch laptops on the market. Whether you&#x2019;re a professional or a creative or even a student, the Surface Book 2 will handle your daily workload effortlessly and in style. What&#x2019;s more, the dynamic fulcrum hinge is much improved this time around, complementing the robust quad-core processor. And, unlike many other 2-in-1 laptops, the keyboard is removable to make it much more manageable, as well as thinner, when in tablet mode.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-book-2-13-inch">Microsoft Surface Book 2</a></p>

<p>You may be expecting a gaming laptop, especially given Razer&#x2019;s reputation. But in reality, the Razer Blade Stealth just happens to be one of the best 13-inch laptops to buy today. It&#x2019;s thin, light, and packed with the latest Ultrabook-class internals &#x2013; including dedicated MX150 graphics, which means you can play your favorite titles on the go. The 8th-generation Intel Whiskey Lake Processor makes this laptop a force to be reckoned with. Of course, that comes at a cost. However, the sheer style and build quality might be worth it.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/razer-blade-stealth-13">Razer Blade Stealth</a>&#xA0;</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re looking for a speedy and svelte 13-inch laptop to schlep around with you &#x2013; and you don&#x2019;t mind sacrificing some premium features, then you&#x2019;ll love the Asus ZenBook 13. Coming in at just half an inch thick and weighing only 2.5 pounds, this is the ideal laptop for traveling. But, don&#x2019;t think you have to compromise on power with all this portability. The Asus ZenBook 13 boasts quad-core Intel chips, 8GB of RAM and up to 1TB SSD. Its combination of power, portability and pretty easily makes it one of the best <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-asus-laptops"><u>Asus laptops</u></a> around. The only thing you&#x2019;re missing here is a USB-C port, but it&#x2019;s easy to overlook, especially on a laptop as stylish as this. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/asus-zenbook-13">Asus Zenbook 13</a>&#xA0;</p>

<p>Thanks to its sleek 13-inch design, this 2-in-1 is slimmer that you would have expected, which works in your favor when using it in tablet mode. There are other compelling reasons why you must consider the HP Envy x360 (2019) when sorting through the best 13-inch laptops on the market. This one boasts a premium build, 9 hours of video playback and a performance that will get you through most of your schoolwork and project, all without burning a hole in your pocket.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hp-envy-x360-13-2019"><u>HP Envy x360 (2019)</u></a></p>

<p>The early Surface Laptop had our vote for one of the best 13-inch laptops, due to its stunning screen, competent internals and solid build quality. We are, therefore, happy to find its sequel, the Surface Laptop 2, doing everything better and taking some features to a new level. You won&#x2019;t find any drastic changes, but the faster 8th-generation CPUs, 8GB of RAM and, most importantly, the removal of Windows 10 S all add up to making the Surface Laptop 2 one of the best 13-inch laptops right now.</p><p><strong>Read the full review</strong>: <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review">Surface Laptop 2</a></p>

<p>While slightly bigger than your usual 13-inch laptop, this nearly 14-inch 2-in-1 challenger has a few aces up its sleeve &#x2013; including longevity, power and durability. This means that the latest Lenovo Yoga C930 will last users long enough to get through their day-to-day workload and some entertainment at the end of each day. To round it all out, this device also has a nice display with deep colors, a solid keyboard and a decent trackpad. It may not have the best graphics performance, but it definitely more than makes up for that, making it one of the best 13-inch laptops 2019 has to offer.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/lenovo-yoga-c930"><u>Lenovo Yoga C930</u></a></p>

<p>The MacBook Pro 2018 feels like the final form of Apple&#x2019;s pro series laptop since its 2016 redesign. It still boasts that thin and light design, while also bringing a wealth of improvements both to the hardware within and the Butterfly keyboard outside to make it quieter and more reliable. With this redesigned keyboard, you don&#x2019;t have to worry about it breaking all because a piece of dust appeared under the spacebar. If you need an ultra-portable workhorse running macOS Mojave and can justify the cost, the 2018 MacBook Pro won&#x2019;t let you down.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/macbook-pro-2018-with-touch-bar-13-inch">MacBook Pro (13-inch Mid-2018)</a>&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Bill Thomas, Gabe Carey and Michelle Rae Uy have also contributed to this article</strong></p>

      <description>Nvidia could be working on a new GeForce RTX graphics card based on its TU102 die. Here’s everything we know about it so far.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fresh off the release of its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-super-rtx"><u>Super RTX</u></a> graphics cards, Nvidia might not be done giving AMD a run for its money. According to <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-t10-8-tu102,40166.html" target="_blank"><u>Tom&#x2019;s Hardware</u></a>, the Santa Clara company is working on an all-new graphics card that will likely surpass or match its most powerful models.</p><p>Nvidia hasn&#x2019;t revealed any plans to design a Super version of its incredibly powerful Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti, but these new details certainly highlight the possibility.</p>
<ul ><li>Find the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-geforce"><u>best Nvidia graphics cards 2019</u></a> for you</li><li>Update your drivers to patch <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-graphics-cards-vulnerable-to-security-flaw"><u>Nvidia GPUs&#x2019; security hole</u></a></li><li>Here are all the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458"><u>best graphics cards of 2019</u></a></li></ul>
<p><a href="https://www.aida64.com/" target="_blank"><u>AIDA64</u></a>, a system information, diagnostics and benchmarking solution for Windows, recently added data in its changelog regarding a previously unannounced &#x201C;Nvidia GeForce RTX T10-8&#x201D; graphics card, teasing a graphics processor (GPU) that could be joining Nvidia&#x2019;s highly popular gaming line.</p>
<h3>It&#x2019;s all about the die</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not a lot of information is available about this Nvidia GeForce RTX T10-8 card at this time. What we do know is that it&#x2019;s based on Nvidia&#x2019;s TU102 die, the very same found in the RTX 2080 Ti and GeForce Titan RTX, and that its current moniker highly suggests that it might be intended for the gaming market.</p><p>This new card could possibly be a &#x2018;Black&#x2019; version of the GeForce Titan RTX, and boast a faster factory clock speed or more memory (as that card already uses a maxed-out TU102 die).&#xA0;</p><p>However, it&#x2019;s also likely that the GeForce RTX T10-8 will be something akin to a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Super, which will put in it between these two cards as far as price and performance.</p><p>If this is indeed the Super version of the RTX 2080 Ti, we&#x2019;re expecting more CUDA cores and faster memory at the very least, just like what Nvidia pulled with the RTX 2080 Super. To make it worth the upgrade for many users, however, we&#x2019;d like to see a considerable performance boost.&#xA0;</p><p>Ultimately, we don&#x2019;t want to see another <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-super"><u>Nvidia RTX 2080 Super</u></a>, which has been a bit of a letdown, as&#xA0;the performance increase it offers just isn&apos;t enough to blow our minds.&#xA0;</p><p>Will this Nvidia GeForce RTX T10-8 GPU end up being the most powerful RTX card yet, or will it live somewhere in between? Only the inevitable spec sheet and price will tell.&#xA0;</p>

      <description>Microsoft's premium Surface devices are getting throttled by an issue that may be tied to a recent firmware update.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft&apos;s <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-pro-6">Surface Pro 6</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-book-2">Surface Book 2</a> are running into some crippling issues, as processor (CPU) clock speeds throttle down incredibly low speeds, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-surface-pro-6-and-surface-book-2-devices-are-throttle-locking-to-400-mhz/" target="_blank">TechRepublic reports</a>. The report comes from user complaints that indicate their machines&apos; Intel processors are slowing down to as low as 400MHz.</p><p>For reference, the lowest-spec Surface Pro 6 runs an Intel Core i5-8250U processor, which normally clocks at 1.6GHz. That&apos;s four times faster than the throttled speed users have experienced. And, that CPU can boost up to 3.4Ghz, more than eight times faster than the reduced clock speed.</p><p>The culprit for the throttling is unclear, but the systems in these instances are reporting a &quot;BD PROCHOT&quot; CPU flag that indicates that some component inside the computer is running too hot, which results in the CPU throttling to decrease the temperatures inside the computer. Unfortunately, the throttling doesn&apos;t stop, as the 400MHz clock speed remains for some even after shutting down and rebooting the computer.</p>
<ul ><li>See how the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-book-s-vs-microsoft-surface-pro-6">Surface Pro 6 and Galaxy Book S stack up</a></li><li>Here&apos;s our pick of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-laptops-1304361">best laptops of 2019</a></li><li>These are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-2-in-1-laptops-top-5-hybrid-laptops-reviewed-1258451">best 2-in-1 laptops</a></li></ul>
<h3>But, which component?</h3>
<p>Normally, you&apos;d hope for the computer temperatures to go down and have CPU return to normal speeds after the component that raised the flag stops overheating. But, in this case, it&apos;s not clear that any component actually is overheating.&#xA0;</p><p>Some users did suggest the throttling stopped when disconnecting a Surface Dock or AC adapter, while others suggest antivirus software may be at fault. What may be the root of it all is a firmware update. One was recently released for the Surface Pro 6.</p><p>This wouldn&apos;t be the first time an update caused issues for Microsoft&apos;s machines. Just recently, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-surface-devices-reportedly-hit-some-wi-fi-problems-with-latest-update">Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers were hit</a> with issues, and the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-10-may-2019-update-is-causing-trouble-with-surface-book-2">Windows 10 May 2019 update has caused problems for the Surface Book 2</a>.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson told TechRepublic, &quot;We are aware of some customers reporting a scenario with their Surface Books where CPU speeds are slowed. We are quickly working to address via a firmware update.&quot;</p>

      <title>The best 2-in-1 laptop 2019: find the best convertible laptop for your needs</title>

      <description>Alongside the impressive HP Spectre x360 15T (2019), these are the best 2-in-1 laptops around.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last decade, thanks in large part to the best 2-in-1 laptops, we have changed the way we use our laptops. There&#x2019;s nothing like flipping one of these top 2-in-1 laptops into tent mode to watch Netflix or into tablet mode for playing Plants vs Zombies after a long yet productive day of work in laptop mode.</p><p>Hybrid laptops come in many shapes, sizes and levels of power. Many of the best 2-in-1 laptops &#x2013; like the Dell XPS 15 2-in-1, for one &#x2013; come packing with the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-processors"><u>best processors</u></a>, which also makes them some of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-laptops-1304361"><u>best laptops</u></a> on the market right now. And, we can&#x2019;t wait to see what the future holds for this versatile form factor.</p>
<p>The best 2-in-1 laptops are, more often than not, convertible, so the keyboard flips around the back, transforming the device into a tablet. Other devices, like the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-book-2">Surface Book 2</a>, approach it differently. Microsoft&#x2019;s convertible has a detachable screen, and its high-resolution PixelSense display is held up by sheer magnetic force when in laptop mode.</p><p>No matter how they deliver the 2-in-1 functionality however, these versatile laptops usually have stylus compatibility &#x2013; even if it&#x2019;s now becoming rarer to find a stylus included in the box.</p><p>To help you choose the best 2-in-1 laptop that matches your needs and budget, gathered all the best hybrid notebooks we recently tested, taking all their pros and cons into account.</p>
<p><img  id="XCULUYnNVKJXpXqwV2GGXU" name="" alt="HP Spectre x360 15T (2019)" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCULUYnNVKJXpXqwV2GGXU.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>For years, HP&#x2019;s Spectre line of Ultrabooks and 2-in-1 laptops has been about blending elegance with performance. The 2019 HP Spectre x360 15 is no different. It deserves a top spot on our best 2-in-1 laptops list for packing an 8th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics and 8GB of RAM in its base configuration. This 2-in-1 can handle pretty much anything your everyday workload throws at it &#x2013; and then some (like a bit of light gaming, for example) &#x2013; while looking like royalty. Bear in mind that the Spectre x360 is a bit big and heavy for a 2-in-1, so you likely won&#x2019;t be using it in tablet mode that often. Put it in tent mode instead, so you can watch some movies on its spectacular 4K display.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hp-spectre-x360-15t-2019"><u>HP Spectre x360 15T (2019)</u></a></p>

<p>It might strike you as odd that a Chromebook is on a list of the best 2-in-1 laptops, and rated so high at that. But, let us assure you that it isn&#x2019;t a mistake. The Google Pixelbook merges the two forms perfectly. It&#x2019;s an impressive device that takes the Chrome OS platform and elevates it to levels never seen before when it first rolled out. The Google Pixelbook is fitted with powerful components, as well as supports full Android apps, tearing down those walls that prevented Mac and Windows devotees from truly embracing the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-top-5-chromebooks-in-the-us-1233696"><u>best Chromebooks</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixelbook">Google Pixelbook</a></p>

<p>The Pixelbook is downright tempting, but it&#x2019;s not for the economical buyers and other users who might prefer to go for the Asus Chromebook Flip C302, a worthy pinch hitter. Having introduced a touchscreen hybrid design to Google&#x2019;s cloud-based Chrome OS, the Asus Chromebook Flip is made better by its compatibility with Android apps. Just like the Pixelbook, you can use the Asus Chromebook Flip for Google Play apps, albeit after installing an out-of-the-box update. It&#x2019;s without a doubt one of the best 2-in-1 laptops right now. And, if you&apos;re already a fan of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-asus-laptops"><u>Asus laptops</u></a>, this one will make you a true convert.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/asus-chromebook-flip-c302"><u>Asus Chromebook Flip</u></a></p>

<p>The HP Spectre x360 isn&#x2019;t just one of the best 2-in-1 laptops on the market; it&#x2019;s also one of the best laptops to date. There are only a handful of manufacturers out there that combine powerful components with a dazzling design quite as well as HP does here. The gem cut chassis will draw plenty of jealous looks in the office, while the formidable hardware will breeze through all of your daily workload. That light and compact design &#x2013; well, it&#x2019;s so delightful you&#x2019;ll fall in love at first sight. And, when you&#x2019;ve had enough showcasing is prowess, you can flip it around into tablet mode to squeeze in some late-night gaming.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hp-spectre-x360-2016">HP Spectre x360</a></p>

<p>Are you in the market for one of the best 2-in-1 laptops that delivers solid performance and serious horsepower? Well, you&#x2019;ll find it in the Dell XPS 15, which incidentally gets our vote as one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-ultrabook-18-top-thin-and-lights-1054355"><u>best Ultrabooks</u></a> you can buy today. This 2-in-1 is perhaps among the most coveted 2-in-1 laptops &#x2013; with discrete class Radeon RX Vega graphics to boot. With it, you get a gorgeous convertible that doesn&#x2019;t sacrifice sheer power. So, while it has a price tag that&#x2019;s a bit on the high end, it&#x2019;s also completely worth breaking the piggy bank.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dell-xps-15-2-in-1">Dell XPS 15 2-in-1</a>&#xA0;</p>

<p>We had nothing but love for the original Surface Book. Needless to say, when we heard that there was going to be a 15-inch Surface Book 2, we could barely contain our excitement. Unfortunately, in the end, the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 isn&#x2019;t the best 2-in-1 laptop out there. However, it&#x2019;s still an impressive machine that&#x2019;s only held back by a handful of compromises that were necessary to begin with. This 2-in-1 laptop features cutting-edge 8th-generation processors as well as Nvidia 10-series graphics for gamers and creatives alike. Combine that with its unique convertible solution, and the Surface Book 2 is an ace in our book.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-book-2-13-inch">Microsoft Surface Book 2 (13-inch)</a></p>

<p>Sleek, slim and boasting solid specs to boot, the new Lenovo Yoga C930 is undeniably worthy of a spot in the best 2-in-1 laptops list. And, that&#x2019;s without mentioning the fact that it now offers a 4K display model, so that high-end viewing experience and decent gaming may be had once users have gotten their day-to-day workload out of the way. This 2-in-1 is a strong contender for consumers strapped for cash, but if you do decide to go for gold, be ready to break the bank.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lenovo-yoga-c930"><u>Lenovo Yoga C930</u></a></p>

<p>It&#x2019;s no secret that we&#x2019;re fans of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 13-inch, seeing as how we only raved about it earlier in this list. But how about its 15-inch counterpart? Well, with its long battery life, high-end specs that will breeze through the demands of day-to-day workload as well as a lot of entertainment, and of course, its unique design features, we&#x2019;re inclined to feel the same way. This model isn&#x2019;t for the budget shoppers, however. However, if you do have the money, its base model with 256GB storage is well worth the $2,499 tag and the best 2-in-1 laptop money can buy.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-book-2">Microsoft Surface Book 2 (15-inch)</a></p>

<p>Thanks to its sleek, 13-inch design, this 2-in-1 is slimmer that you would have expected, which works in your favor when using it in tablet mode. There are other compelling reasons why the HP Envy x360 (2019) is worth considering when you&#x2019;re in the market for the best 2-in-1 laptops. This HP beauty offers a premium build, boasts 9 hours of video playback and delivers a performance that will get you through most of your schoolwork and project, at a very affordable price.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hp-envy-x360-13-2019"><u>HP Envy x360 (2019)</u></a></p>

<p>Acer has a knack for designing economical laptops that are reliable enough for your typical productivity tasks and some viewing pleasures. They&#x2019;re proving that once again with their cut-rate contender, the Acer Chromebook Spin 11, declared by many as one of the best Chromebooks to have hit the shelves to date. Some compromises were made, understandably with its price tag of $330, including that subpar battery life. But for budget buyers who are unlikely to tackle processor-intensive work, this one&#x2019;s for the books.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-11">Acer Chromebook Spin 11</a></p>

      <description>The updated Nintendo Switch offers more battery life than the original, and a test has proven it.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo will have a new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-lite-release-date-price-games-and-more">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> model to offer in September, but it now has a refresh version of the original <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> that can offer improved battery life over its predecessor. And, it has shown a substantial increase in playtime in a test by our sister site, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/new-nintendo-switch-battery-life-tested-how-much-better-is-it" target="_blank">Tom&apos;s Guide</a>.</p><p>The test they conducted involved running two Nintendo Switches, an old model and a new model, side by side at maximum brightness for an endless Super Smash Bros. Ultimate match of eight computer-controlled characters with increased AI and all items enabled.</p><p>The result of the test was 4 hours and 50 minutes for the updated Nintendo Switch and 2 hours and 45 minutes for the original Nintendo Switch. It&apos;s worth noting that the original had been purchased and in use since 2017, so the battery may have seen some degradation in charge capacity.</p><p>But, the results still speak strongly to the increases in battery life of the revised model. Nintendo rates the original Switch battery life at 2.5 to 6.5 hours, and the new Switch at 4.5 to 9 hours. The test showed both devices falling within Nintendo&apos;s suggested ranges.</p>
<ul ><li>Hear our <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/fireside-chat-is-a-nintendo-switch-pro-really-happening">thoughts on a Nintendo Switch Pro</a></li><li>See how the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-vs-nintendo-switch-lite-is-bigger-really-better">Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite compare</a></li><li>These are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-deals">cheapest Nintendo Switch bundle deals</a></li></ul>
<h3>Efficiency over size</h3>
<p>Interestingly, the size of the Nintendo Switch&apos;s battery hasn&apos;t changed between the revisions. The new model still has the original 4,310mAh battery capacity.</p><p>And, since Nintendo doesn&apos;t details the specifics of other internal components, it&apos;s unclear where exactly the battery life gains are coming from. But, there had been some early <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/upgraded-nintendo-switch-could-join-new-lite-model-according-to-fcc-filing">suggestions that the new Switch would be more efficient</a>. This test seems to prove it, and it could come down to an improved version Nvidia&apos;s custom Tegra X1 processor that powers the Switch.</p><p>If you&apos;re in the market for a Nintendo Switch, make sure you pay attention to whether you&apos;re getting the new or original model, as it will make a big difference in your mobile gaming experience.</p>

      <description>Slack's new “State of Work Report” highlights how employee alignment can affect a business' growth and success.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new survey from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/slack-ups-security-to-keeps-your-chats-protected">Slack</a> has revealed that millions of employees are &#x201C;unaligned&#x201D; and this puts them at odds with their organization&apos;s strategy, vision and operating principles.</p><p>To compile its new &#x201C;<a href="https://slackhq.com/slack-state-of-work-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">State of Work Report</a>&#x201D; the company behind the popular <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-online-collaboration-tools">online collaboration tool</a> worked together with the market research firm GlobalWebIndex (GWI) to survey 17,000 global knowledge workers, managers and executives.</p><p>Slack wanted to learn more about their experiences in the modern workforce and did so by asking them what do aligned workers look like, why does having aligned workers matter and how do companies attract and retain aligned workers.</p>
<ul ><li>Slack ups security to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/slack-ups-security-to-keeps-your-chats-protected">keep your chats protected</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/slack-valued-at-over-dollar20bn-after-going-public">Slack valued at over $20bn</a> after going public</li><li>Slack joins forces with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/slack-joins-forces-with-microsoft-office-365">Microsoft Office 365</a></li></ul>
<p>The report found that 1 in 10 global knowledge workers believe they are &#x201C;unaligned&#x201D; while 15 percent of UK workers believe they are completely unaligned with their organization&apos;s mission.</p>
<h3>Aligned vs unaligned workers</h3>
<p>Slack&apos;s research discovered that only 34 percent of unaligned workers believe their organization&apos;s teams are working toward a shared vision. Of the unaligned workers surveyed, 70 percent either &#x201C;agree&#x201D; or &#x201C;strongly agree&#x201D; that they would like to feel more aligned with their company&apos;s vision, values and operating principles.</p><p>Aligned workers on the other hand, are the most connected to a company&apos;s vision and strategy which leads them to approach their work with optimism and they are more likely to focus on high-value business activities.&#xA0;</p><p>According to the report, the difference between aligned and unaligned workers has a significant impact on business prospects. Aligned workers in the UK are nearly twice as likely as unaligned workers to expect &#x201C;significant growth&#x201D; in their company&apos;s revenue and workforce. Unaligned workers in the UK though are three times more likely to expect &#x201C;significant decline&#x201D; in their company&apos;s revenue and growth.</p><p>Slack suggests that organizations can help nurture alignment by implementing a clear and frequently communicated strategy with a thoughtful approach to information overload.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protests within the tech industry are gaining momentum and now <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/google-and-vmware-sign-cloud-migration-deal">Google</a> employees are petitioning the search giant not to bid on a cloud contract with US Customs and Border Protection (<a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/us-customs-data-breach-sees-traveler-information-stolen">CBP</a>).</p><p>A new petition, which began circulating inside the company and on <a href="https://medium.com/@no.gcp.for.cbp/google-must-stand-against-human-rights-abuses-nogcpforcbp-88c60e1fc35e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Medium</a>, was created by a group of employees who called out immigration officials for &#x201C;penetrating a system of abuse and malign neglect&#x201D; at the US border.</p><p>The employees also highlighted the Trump administration&apos;s family separation policy as well as the recent deaths of immigrant children at the border as reasons why Google should end its work with CBP.</p>

<p>Just a few hours after the petition was released, hundreds of employees publicly signed the document to show the company how important this issue is to them.</p>
<h3>CBP cloud computing contract</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://medium.com/@no.gcp.for.cbp/google-must-stand-against-human-rights-abuses-nogcpforcbp-88c60e1fc35e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">petition</a>, the employees call on the company to end its work with CBP while also stating that they will not work on the contract if it is awarded to Google, saying:</p><p>&#x201C;It has recently come to light that CBP&#xA0;is gearing up to request bids&#xA0;on a massive cloud computing contract. The winning cloud provider will be streamlining CBP&#x2019;s infrastructure and facilitating its human rights abuses. It&#x2019;s time to stand together again and state clearly that we will not work on any such contract. We demand that&#xA0;Google publicly commit not to support CBP, ICE, or ORR with any infrastructure, funding, or engineering resources, directly or indirectly, until they stop engaging in human rights abuses.&#x201D;</p><p>This is just the latest in a series of protests within the tech industry as a whole and inside Google where employees have begun to question the moral implications of how their work will be used. Previously, Google employees successfully protested the company&apos;s plan to work alongside the US government on an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know">AI</a> system designed to analyze drone footage called <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/google-urged-to-work-with-us-military">Project Maven</a>.</p><p>Google has yet to publicly respond to the petition but we&apos;ll keep following this story as it develops to see whether or not this latest protest ends up being a success as well.</p>

<p>If you fell head over heels upon seeing the Alienware Area-51m&#x2019;s quirky and stunning white chassis, you&#x2019;re not alone. And, if you happen to shell out that couple of thousand dollars based on looks alone, you&#x2019;ll be happy to know that it wasn&#x2019;t all for naught, as this gaming laptop &#x2013; or rather, the best gaming laptop of 2019 &#x2013; packs a hefty punch, gaming-wise.

<p>These days, the best gaming laptop manufacturers are scrambling to design the thinnest gaming laptop that also showcase raw power. At the moment, the one that might be leading the charge might just be the Asus ROG Zephyrus GX701. At just 0.7 inches thick, this beast of a laptop boasts an Intel Coffee Lake Core i7 chip, Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q graphics and 16GB of RAM. That means you can play any PC game under the sun on Ultra, and also take it with you wherever you go &#x2013; excellent for travelers with a penchant for gaming. Plus, it&#x2019;s packed with RGB lighting that&#x2019;ll dazzle just about anyone.</p><p><strong>Read the full review</strong>: <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/asus-rog-zephyrus-s-gx701"><u>Asus ROG Zephyrus S GX701</u></a>&#xA0;</p>

<p>Play some of the best PC games on the move and very discreetly with the MSI GS65 Stealth, which might just be the gaming laptop of your dreams. Coming in at just 0.69 inches thick and featuring impressive hardware like Intel Coffee Lake processors and Nvidia GeForce GTX 10-series &#x2013; refreshed with RTX 20-series graphics at CES &#x2013; the MSI GS65 Stealth packs a punch in its very svelte package. There&#x2019;s nothing you won&#x2019;t be able to throw at this thing that&#x2019;ll slow it down. And, thanks to the smart aesthetic, you&#x2019;ll be able to lug this beefy rig everywhere you go, making it the best gaming laptop to hit the streets.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/msi-gs65-stealth">MSI GS65 Stealth</a>&#xA0;</p>

<p>For a few years now, the Razer Blade has consistently been named as one of the best gaming laptops on the market. And for good reason, as it packs some powerful components and boasts a beautiful display in its elegant chassis. That&#x2019;s true for the 2019 model as well, which now rocks up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080. That is, frankly, a ton of power for a laptop with this thin. If that&#x2019;s not enough graphics power for you, you can use the Razer Core for future expansion. Make no mistake: it is pricey; but it might be worth it if style and power are equally important to you.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/razer-blade-2019-review">Razer Blade</a></p>

<p>The Lenovo Legion Y740 packs a lot of muscle inside its stylish yet accessible chassis, combining a very high refresh rate, Nvidia Turing graphics and a powerful processor with a gloriously effective thermal cooling, a cable management system and a number of applications for customizations. It&#x2019;s as close to a complete package as you can get, wrapped in a stunning chassis that you&#x2019;d be proud to show off to friends and strangers. It still has the remnants of that gaming aesthetic, but it&#x2019;s made elegant so that you could be gaming in public and no one would be the wiser. Despite its shortcomings &#x2013; unfortunate keyboard and webcam placement, as well as its subpar battery life &#x2013; it&#x2019;s still one of the best gaming laptops to date.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lenovo-legion-y740"><u>Lenovo Legion Y740</u></a></p>

<p>A small number of gaming laptops just don&#x2019;t pull any punches, enabling you to run any game you can imagine on Ultra without breaking a sweat &#x2013; and the MSI GT75 Titan is a terrific example. It&#x2019;s a behemoth of desktop replacement, packed with 6-core Intel Coffee Lake processors, plenty of RAM and powerful Nvidia Pascal graphics. Aptly named, this is indeed a titan, and is neither portable nor cafe-friendly. However, if raw power is what you&#x2019;re after, this is the best gaming laptop for you, as long as you&#x2019;re prepared to shell out the money.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/msi-gt75-titan">MSI GT75 Titan</a></p>

<p>It may not have the most original or inventive design, trading in the usual black and red aesthetic for one that makes it feel like Halloween all year round (no complaints here, but some might not find it particularly appealing). Yet, it&#x2019;s still one of the best laptops when it comes to gaming in 1080p. In fact, we are able to crank the settings all the way up in Overwatch without ever dipping below 60fps. It doesn&#x2019;t offer the longest battery life, but just have your charger on hand at all times. Plus, the screen, power and onboard sound system more than make up for it.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/asus-rog-strix-gl502-1326519/review">Asus ROG Strix GL502</a></p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re seeking a gaming powerhouse, but you don&#x2019;t have the cash to shell out for one of those svelte gaming laptops, the Acer Predator Helios 500 is the obvious choice. It&#x2019;s packed with up to an Intel Core i9 processor and full-fat Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics, and therefore will be able to handle any game you throw at it. It&#x2019;s not the most portable device in the world, and the speakers and trackpad are mediocre, but when it comes to gaming, you&#x2019;ve still got an ace here.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/acer-predator-helios-500">Acer Predator Helios 500</a></p>

<p>Thin like an Ultrabook, yet powerful as any gaming machine should, and with an incredible cooling system to boot, the Asus Zephyrus S GX531GX is one of the best gaming laptops we&#x2019;ve reviewed in 2019. It boasts an 8th-generation Intel Core i7 backed by Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q graphics and up to 24GB RAM, which means that this beast should take you a long way in gaming, whether you&#x2019;re a casual gamer or a pro. We&#x2019;re huge fans, though probably not of how much it costs. This pricey powerhouse is not for the shallow-pocketed, but with premium components come a premium price. Only invest if you&#x2019;ve got the tenders.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/asus-rog-zephyrus-s-gx531gx"><u>Asus Zephyrus S GX531GX</u></a></p>

<p>Fitting the svelte yet cheap bill, on the other hand, is the Gigabyte Aero 15, which &#x2013; at 0.74 inches. Despite its thin chassis, it still delivers top-notch gaming performance. That&#x2019;s mostly thanks to its Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 and an Intel Core i9 CPU. It&#x2019;s also ray tracing ready, making it even more future-proof. However, its thin form factor is a double-edged sword: the Core i9 gets way too hot and can throttle. Keep that in mind if you plan on doing any sustained creative work, like editing all your videos. And, maybe have a desk fan or cooler on hand.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gigabyte-aero-15-2019">Gigabyte Aero 15</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Free blogging sites have come a long way in recent years, and it&#x2019;s now easier than ever to create a professional-looking blog to share a hobby with likeminded people, express your opinions, and establish an online presence.</p><p>These free blogging sites are aimed at hobbyist bloggers &#x2013; blogs are created and managed online, and hosted on the blogging platform&#x2019;s own servers. If you want to create a self-hosted blog, <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the downloadable version of WordPress</a> is an excellent option, with total flexibility, support for third-party plugins, and as much storage as your hosting plan allows.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in making a static website rather than an online journal, <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-website-builder">take a look at our guide to the best free website builders</a>.</p>

<a  href="https://wixstats.com/?a=18408&amp;c=2545&amp;s1=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure><p><img  id="sZtk5ufJaVZTdu46ueLWyi" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZtk5ufJaVZTdu46ueLWyi.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>Wix makes it dead easy to design and realize your blog, and you can do a lot more besides</p></figcaption></figure></a>
<p><a href="https://wixstats.com/?a=18408&amp;c=2545&amp;s1=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wix</a> has a range of paid-for subscription plans, but also a free offering, although it&#x2019;s best to note upfront that this has some caveats. With the free product, your site will have Wix branding, and you&#x2019;ll be limited to 500MB of data transfer per month, so it&#x2019;s not for heavily trafficked sites. You also only get 500MB storage, too, so bear that in mind.</p><p>You are, however, free to build a blog with an unlimited number of pages, and where Wix really shines is with its powerful blog functionality. The editor may be simple, but you get access to all the stuff you need &#x2013; from image galleries through to videos and music &#x2013; and there are a ton of ways to customize a post.</p><p>There&#x2019;s also a lot of flexibility in the way you can schedule posts, and neat touches like being able to set things up so that posts are automatically pushed to Facebook when they&#x2019;re published. For instance, you have a feature called WiX Bookings, that allows customers to schedule appointments and classes right on your website.</p><p>And what makes Wix truly compelling is on top of this, you get the run of the rest of what this website builder offers aside from blog support. That includes using Wix&#x2019;s ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence) editor to make building your site a snap even for novices, plus impressively diverse support for various different types of media, and quality customer support to boot (yes, even on the free plan). &#xA0;As of recently, Wix introduced Wix Turbo, which increases the speed and performance of websites considerably.</p><p>When you consider what you&#x2019;re getting for nothing, the bandwidth and data limits don&#x2019;t seem like such a heavy set of shackles. And you can always upgrade at a later date if you want to break free of them in the longer run.</p><p><strong>Try it online: </strong><a href="https://wixstats.com/?a=18408&amp;c=2545&amp;s1=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u><strong>Wix</strong></u></a></p>

<a  href="http://www.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure><p><img  id="GhghWVQTLxyN8oGufaoysT" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GhghWVQTLxyN8oGufaoysT.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption>You can host a WordPress blog yourself, or create one online and have it hosted at wordpress.com</figcaption></figure></a>
<p>Powerful and highly customizable, <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WordPress</a> is a brilliant platform for blogs of any size, and bloggers of any level of experience.</p><p>Creating your first blog is very straightforward, with a simple wizard that guides you through the process of choosing a name and suitable theme. You can leave it there and begin writing posts immediately, but the real fun lies in the more advanced editor, which lets you customize virtually every aspect of your blog&#x2019;s appearance.</p><p>Unlike some blogging sites, WordPress isn&#x2019;t a drag-and-drop affair, and you&#x2019;ll have to familiarize yourself with its system of menus. It&#x2019;s well worth the effort, though, and enables you to create something truly personal. The editor also lets you create static pages &#x2013; like a writer&#x2019;s biography, for example.</p><p>The post-writing interface is much like an ordinary desktop word processor (though some options are presented in a toolbar at the top, while others are in a menu at the side, which can be a little confusing at first). Again, time spent getting to know the interface is rewarded with advanced features like customizable social media sharing buttons, geotagging, and the ability to pick a custom style for individual posts.</p><p>Sometimes you might want to create a photo gallery, for example, and other times a more text-focused style would be more appropriate. You can also view and edit the HTML source.</p><p>As your blog grows, WordPress lets you track its stats, including page views, visitors, likes and comments over time. You can also see how readers reach your site, which content they viewed, and where they are in the world, so you can tailor your content accordingly.</p><p>Your site is hosted on WordPress servers, with an address in the format yoursite.wordpress.com. Users of the free service don&#x2019;t get email or live chat support, but <a href="https://en.forums.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the WordPress community forums</a> are very active and questions are usually answered within a few minutes. Additionally, privacy protection for domains that are registered at WordPress.com is free.</p><p>WordPress displays ads on free blogs, but provided you can live with that, it&#x2019;s a top-notch solution for a free blogging site.</p><p><strong>Try it online: </strong><a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>WordPress</strong></a></p>

<a  href="http://www.blogger.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure><p><img  id="hKGi33aHjimhDtpUjrNWrT" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hKGi33aHjimhDtpUjrNWrT.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>Blogger has been around for many years, but has kept up with current trends and technology, including responsive blog templates</p></figcaption></figure></a>
<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blogger</a> is another superb blogging platform. It&#x2019;s not quite as powerful as WordPress, but more accessible for new users, which comes as no surprise when you learn that it&#x2019;s owned by Google.</p><p>Blogger offers an excellent selection of templates, all of which include mobile versions optimized for smaller screens &#x2013; a very sensible addition with so many people accessing online content through smartphones.&#xA0;</p><p>Blogger&#x2019;s post-editing tool is much like WordPress, but offers fewer options. As a result, its toolbars are less confusing &#x2013; a trade-off between power and usability.</p><p>One of Blogger&#x2019;s best features is its integration with other Google apps and services. For example, it uses your Google Drive account to store images and other files for your blog. Google Drive gives you 15GB of space free, so Blogger is a good choice if you&#x2019;re planning to share a lot of high-res photos.</p><p>Spam comments are a big problem on blogs, so Blogger&#x2019;s automatic spam filter can help save your sanity. You can monitor comments via Blogger&#x2019;s dashboard, which also lets you see visitor stats. There are some handy visualizations here, including a world map to show the global distribution of your readers.</p><p>Your blog will have an address in the format yoursite.blogger.com, and, like all Google services, will include ads. Support is available through <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/blogger " rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Blogger user forum</a>, which is very active but has a strange layout that can be a little off-putting.</p><p>In all other respects, Blogger is brilliant &#x2013; one of the best free blogging sites if you prioritize ease of use over flexibility and are a fan of the Google ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Try it online: </strong><a href="http://www.blogger.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Blogger</strong></a></p>

<a  href="http://www.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure><p><img  id="DKxu2Jxpr9Ca93PUceWVmT" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DKxu2Jxpr9Ca93PUceWVmT.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption>Blogs on Weebly are built from a combination of content blocks</figcaption></figure></a>
<p><a href="http://www.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Weebly</a> takes a modular approach to blog building, with a drag-and-drop editor that lets you choose which elements to add to your site, and where.&#xA0;</p><p>Pick a basic template, then plonk various types of content onto the page, including social media links, text, images, maps, and sections of code. It&#x2019;s a refreshingly simple way to build a blog that feels unique to you, but doesn&#x2019;t require any messing about with menus.</p><p>It&#x2019;s worth noting, however, that certain content blocks can only be positioned in certain areas; it isn&#x2019;t a total free-for-all. This makes sense &#x2013; forcing you to stick within the confines of your chosen template stops the page looking messy &#x2013; but you might find it limiting.&#xA0;</p><p>Blog posts are made in the same way: drag text boxes, picture frames, buttons and page breaks into position, then click to edit them. One particularly nice feature is the &#x2018;secret draft link&#x2019;, which lets you preview your unpublished post, and even share it with others via email before releasing it into the wild.&#xA0;</p><p>Weebly has some other interesting tricks up its sleeve too, including an area for pasting in Google Analytics tracking code (though it doesn&#x2019;t offer analytics itself).</p><p>You&#x2019;re only given 500MB for uploaded content, so photographers might want to look elsewhere. Weebly puts an ad in your site&#x2019;s footer, but it doesn&#x2019;t obscure any of your content.</p><p><strong>Try it online: </strong><a href="http://www.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Weebly</strong></a></p>

<a  href="https://penzu.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure><p><img  id="BiMMx9pnfu3B4tn34ebysT" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BiMMx9pnfu3B4tn34ebysT.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>Penzu is a personal blogging tool that lets you create your own private diary</p></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>Whereas the other free blogging sites are designed to get as many eyeballs on your posts as possible, <a href="https://penzu.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Penzu</a> is the equivalent of a locked diary stashed in a safe.</p><p>Penzu is a journal platform that makes your posts private by default and locks them down with at least one password (even after you&#x2019;re logged in, you need a second one to read or edit your posts). That&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s designed for private thoughts and personal reflection. There are free apps for iOS and Android that enable you to update your Penzu diary anywhere, but the contents are for your eyes only.</p><p>Penzu isn&#x2019;t a tool for self-promotion, so although it&#x2019;s far from ugly, it understandably focuses on function rather than looks. Custom colors and backgrounds come at a price &#x2013; <a href="https://penzu.com/app/signup-pro" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently $20 (about &#xA3;14, AU$25) per year</a>.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a shame that 128-bit AES encryption is also limited to the paid-for version, and there&#x2019;s a fair amount of pressure to upgrade. Extra options are often dangled under your nose then yanked away, but the core offering is a good one, and if you simply want a place to record your thoughts and practise writing, Penzu could be just what you need.</p><p><strong>Try it online: </strong><a href="https://penzu.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Penzu</strong></a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of the web has allowed countless businesses to reach a wider market. Not only that, it has given rise to countless new online-only businesses, fueled by the exponential rise of mobile connections.</p><p>It&apos;s not surprising, then, that one analyst claims that the SMB e-commerce platform market will break the billion dollar barrier.</p><p>There&apos;s no doubt that the web provides a huge opportunity for companies, but it&#x2019;s important for organizations to make the most of that opportunity. In order to sell your products or services online, your website has to be appropriately equipped.</p><p>Building an online store from scratch is a mammoth task, and fortunately, an unnecessary one. Today, there is a huge variety of e-commerce platform packages from which to choose.&#xA0;</p><p>Most e-commerce platforms will provide businesses with standard functionality such as the ability to showcase products in an online catalog, take payments online, manage customers and provide with after-sales.</p><p>Others will provide more sophisticated functionality, such as online marketing features, the ability to manage or integrate with in-store systems and the provision of APIs.</p><p>Which e-commerce software is best for your business depends entirely on your specific requirements. If you&apos;re an online-only outfit, then POS integration won&apos;t be necessary, but you may get a lot of business from overseas, in which case foreign currency support would be a requirement.</p><p>In this article, we&#x2019;re going to highlight some of the best e-commerce platforms available right now, before moving on to consider other options you might want to explore in terms of creating your own e-commerce solution.</p>
<h3>The best e-commerce platform packages</h3>
<a  href="https://www.shopify.com/?ref=future-publishing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure><p><img  id="2t66JzPcEW9oTPBeRZg4dA" name="" alt="Shopify" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/23fe1cc3192747aa832bc74e133549ae.jpg" align="" fullscreen="1" class="expandable"></p><figcaption><p><br></p></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>Shopify is perhaps the most well known e-commerce platform available. It was set up in 2006 by founders Tobias L&#xFC;tke, Daniel Weinand and Scott Lake who, as the story goes, felt that there wasn&apos;t a simple-to-use e-commerce platform available and so built their own. The company claims that: &quot;You don&apos;t need to have any technical or design experience to easily create a beautiful online store.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>According to Shopify, it&apos;s possible to get one of its online stores up-and-running within minutes. Users can choose from a wide range of templates, or they can design the look and feel of their store themselves. It accepts a comprehensive range of credit cards, has Level 1 PCI compliance and 256-bit SSL encryption for security, and it offers 24/7 support via phone, instant messaging or email.</p><p>The platform provides a full CMS with which users can manage the functionality and layout of their online store. Users can manage their store on-the-go using Shopify&apos;s mobile apps, and the platform itself is fully responsive, meaning the store will be optimized for visitors regardless of whether they access it from a desktop computer or a mobile device.</p><p>Shopify also offers users unlimited hosting for their stores, in-depth analytics of how visitors are using the store, and functionality for marketing such as SEO optimization, a discount and coupon engine, gift cards and email marketing tools. You can test out Shopify with a 14-day free trial.</p>

<p>Bigcommerce was established in 2009 and promises to &quot;support your business, not just your store.&quot; In addition to offering support via phone, instant chat and email, it also offers articles and videos to help with e-commerce, and access to a team of e-commerce experts who can provide advice and guidance about online selling. Their experts are qualified in both Google Analytics and Adwords.</p><p>Like Shopify, Bigcommerce provides a variety of templates and themes to help stores look their best and get up-and-running quickly. Alternatively, users can design their own store or use Bigcommerce designers to do so. The platform incorporates a full-featured CMS that allows users to run an entire website, rather than just a store.</p><p>Users can benefit from detailed and flexible product management, optimized search engine rankings, along with a variety of integrated marketing tools and analytics. Payments can be accepted via 40+ pre-integrated gateways and shipping details can be customized as per the business&apos;s requirements. As of late, some new features have been added like support for Amazon Import and Link and Shopping in Instagram Stories. The platform offers automated order processing, flexible tax rules depending on where orders are made and shipped, and support for multiple currencies. You can test out Bigcommerce with a 15-day free trial.</p>

<p>Volusion has been around for almost two decades, having been set up in Texas over in the US in 1999. The company touts its platform as being an &quot;all-in-one e-commerce solution&quot;, and offers a free 14-day trial (no credit card required).</p><p>As with other e-commerce platforms, users are offered a variety of templates from which to choose, and can also customize templates if they so wish. Should a more complex design be required, Volusion offers a custom design service that can incorporate branding and a firm&apos;s social media presence.</p><p>The platform provides the site and product management tools you&apos;d expect, marketing functionality for SEO, social media, and affiliate outlets, along with emails and order management functionality for fast order processing, accepting payments, tax calculations and POS integration.</p><p>In addition to its platform and associated services, Volusion offers apps from its partners, support for users and a knowledge-base for help with e-commerce. Users can draw upon blog posts, guides and webinars. As of October 8th 2018, there are no more transaction fees.</p>

<p>CoreCommerce was set up in 2001 and focuses on providing e-commerce services to small and medium-sized businesses. The company places an emphasis on simplicity and transparency, promising that its platform is easy-to-use and that customers will not fall foul of any hidden charges.</p><p>Perhaps CoreCommerce&apos;s most unique aspect is that all of its features are offered to all customers regardless of what plan they are on. Price plans are determined by the number of products, the number of email addresses, the amount of bandwidth and the amount of storage required by the user (and higher-end plans also benefit from additional support).</p><p>As with other e-commerce providers, CoreCommerce offers functionality for store design, product management, order processing and marketing. Of its headline features, the platform offers unlimited product customization options, a built-in blogging engine, and secure hosting that is provided by Rackspace and comes with a 99.9% uptime guarantee.

<ol ><li>Ask the company for live examples of their work to look at</li><li>Write a detailed brief of the site you want created. The more detail the better to avoid confusion</li><li>Ensure you understand the price you are being charged and how many revisions this price includes</li><li>Always have a signed agreement or contract before work commences</li><li>Ask whether the designers will host your site and if you will be able to make updates yourself or if all updates must go through the design agency at an additional cost</li><li>Ask for the copyright of your design to be assigned to your company, as your website is an important part of your business&apos; intellectual property</li><li>Put into your contract, details of how the agreement can be amicably dissolved if things go wrong</li></ol>

      <description>Here's everything that's new in No Man Sky's Beyond update including No Man's Sky VR and No Man's Sky Online. </description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cast your mind back to 2016 - Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s Lemonade was the world&apos;s best selling album, Rogue One dominated the box office, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> was just a codename and a bunch of rumors, and No Man&apos;s Sky had arguably gaming&apos;s roughest launch.</p><p>Built up by creator Sean Murray of Hello Games, alongside Sony, the then <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/sony-ps4-1202432/review">PlayStation 4</a> exclusive launched with billions of planets to explore, but little to do on them. It was a galaxy inhabited by millions of players, but you wouldn&apos;t see any of them. A combination of unrealistic expectations placed upon a small team and an over-zealous publisher, No Man&apos;s Sky left people more than disappointed - many were angry.</p><p>In a world where every company seems to have an active social media feed, and in an industry focused on appeasing shareholders, it was strange to see Hello Games retreat into <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/no-man-s-sky-under-investigation-for-false-advertising-1329563">radio silence</a>. After an unprecedented media blackout of several months, Hello Games plotted a course for redemption for their project that at one point seemed hopelessly lost in space.</p><p>In July 2018, No Man&apos;s Sky Next update took the title to Xbox One, while also adding new multiplayer functionality, improved base building, and full third-person mode for the original PS4 version. This, combined with earlier updates, helped bring No Man&apos;s Sky closer to it&apos;s creators&apos; original vision.</p><p>Of course, the story hasn&apos;t ended there, as players have been abuzz with the recently released Beyond update. Here&apos;s a quick guide to the update, and why now is as good a time as ever to jump into No Man&apos;s Sky.</p>
<h3>When is the Beyond update launching?</h3>
<p>No Man&#x2019;s Sky&#x2019;s Beyond update hit all platforms on Auguts 14, 2019. It&#x2019;s available to download now.</p>
<h3>How much does the Beyond update cost?</h3>
<p>No Man Sky&#x2019;s Beyond update is available for free for anyone that owns No Man&apos;s Sky on any platform. So if you haven&apos;t played in some time, you&apos;ve nothing to lose by jumping in.</p>
<h3>What&apos;s in the Beyond update?</h3>
<p><img  id="f6CF6M3xnmtPJz8jTT2VwF" name="" alt="No Man's Sky Beyond" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f6CF6M3xnmtPJz8jTT2VwF.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Quite a lot, actually. Sean Murray previously stated that &#x2018;Beyond&#x2019; is an amalgamation of three &quot;pillars&quot; - each with a wealth of associated content and changes. Originally intended as three updates, they&apos;ve now been bundled together.</p><p><strong>No Man&apos;s Sky Online<br>
</strong>The first of these pillars is No Man&apos;s Sky Online. As you can imagine, this is an extension of the previous multiplayer update in many ways. Players can now visit a social space called The Nexus, where you can interact with other players and purchase items (no microtransactions, don&apos;t panic).&#xA0;</p><p>You can teleport directly from the Nexus to a friend&apos;s base, and also pick up Multiplayer Missions with new co-operative activities with varied objectives. On console, eight players can now explore together (up from four), while PC players can now take their four player group and expand it to a whopping 32 players.</p>
<p><img  id="tNBWCoVC3qUzQf24GUuaoM" name="" alt="No Man's Sky Beyond" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4f343522117e96103374c5416304397b.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p><strong>No Man&apos;s Sky VR<br>
</strong>The second pillar of the Beyond update is No Man&apos;s Sky VR - which from the name is likely pretty self-explanatory. This isn&apos;t some virtual reality focused addendum to the existing game though - this is the entirety of No Man&apos;s Sky playable in VR, and is compatible with existing saves made before the update too.&#xA0;</p><p>That means you can go from a planet&apos;s surface, into your ship, to the Nexus and back again all within VR. As you can imagine, this is for PlayStation VR players and PC VR owners, so Xbox fans won&apos;t be able to take part. If you can though, you&apos;ll be able to interact with non-VR players on your chosen platform.</p><p>Excitingly, controls have been tweaked too. You can play with a controller, or use a PlayStation Move controller as your ship&apos;s throttle. It changes the game entirely.</p>
<p><img  id="KCqLYVTUecQ5ZeWTRAH9ET" name="" alt="No Man's Sky Beyond" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KCqLYVTUecQ5ZeWTRAH9ET.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p><strong>Loads more<br>
</strong>The final pillar doesn&apos;t have a name, and is a little bit nebulous at present. What we do know is that there&apos;s plenty of options to be added, many of which will likely only be discovered after months of exploration.</p><p>Some alien creatures can be tamed now, for example, while your Last Jedi blue-milk simulator isn&apos;t far away either with milkable creatures and a new cooking system. New environment types are being added too, and base building is being expanded on each planet. Quite simply, there&apos;s a ridiculous amount to be added.&#xA0;</p><p>Aside from the new content, you&apos;ll also find a wealth of quality-of-life improvements. These range from improvements to the game&apos;s tutorials to the previously taxing inventory limitations. With a large portion of players being turned off by the seemingly endless grind of No Man&apos;s Sky, Hello Games are trying to welcome new players and returning ones alike. In fact, much of the game&apos;s UI has been completely redesigned.</p>
<h3>That is a lot, anything else?</h3>
<p>Actually, yes. The entire game has been updated to support Vulkan - overhauling the graphics API. This was actually done back in April, but PC players will now have the ability to change graphics settings without needing to restart the game. Performance is improved too, as is HDR support.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best Chromebooks in 2019 are not just more powerful than ever, but also more flexible and boast longer battery lives. That means that they are capable of so much more than their predecessors.</p><p>Still, before you sort through the best Chromebooks to find the one that suits you best, it&#x2019;s worth your time knowing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-a-google-chromebook"><u>what exactly a Chromebook is</u></a>. You know, in case a lighter weight operating system and device don&#x2019;t actually match your needs.</p><p>To be fair, the best Chromebooks are getting more advanced by the day, and the premium ones especially can see you through more than just your general computing needs. And, the top Chromebooks don&#x2019;t need the latest and greatest processors anyway, as they run Chrome OS and only pack what they need to get the job done. As a perk, they also boast fantastic battery life, which means they&#x2019;ll last you all day and all night.</p><p>Really though, the biggest reason why they&apos;re such an easy sell to users who do not have very demanding computing needs is the price. Chromebooks are generally very affordable &#x2013; though there are some premium ones out there. In fact, many of the best Chromebooks are more affordable than their laptop counterparts.</p><p>If your computer use generally boils down to word processing, emailing, watching Netflix, surfing the internet and mobile gaming, with very light photo and video editing, you really can&#x2019;t go wrong with one of the best Chromebooks.</p><p>And for you, we put together the best Chromebooks that showcase exactly what these affordable Chrome OS-based laptops are capable of.</p>

<p>Not long after declaring the Chromebook Pixel&#x2019;s demise, Google revived it in a way that was completely unexpected. Now, it&#x2019;s the Google Pixelbook, and it stands completely independent of its predecessor. That&#x2019;s owing to the fact, unlike the Chromebook Pixel, it can run Android apps natively, on top of building upon Chrome OS. When you factor in the huge amount of storage space, superb stylus and addition of Google Assistant, it shouldn&#x2019;t surprise you when we say that the Pixelbook is the best Chromebook 2019 has to offer &#x2013; even so long after its launch.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixelbook"><u>Google Pixelbook</u></a></p>

<p>Before Google rolled out the Pixelbook, and showed us exactly what the best Chromebooks should be, the Asus Chromebook Flip was the Google laptop many Google laptops aspire to be. With a full Intel Core processor and a full-HD display, the Asus Chromebook Flip was a game-changer. Put simply, if you want key features that the Pixelbook offers, but you cannot afford its premium price, the Asus Chromebook Flip is the next best thing. If you&apos;re on a budget, this is one of the best <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-asus-laptops"><u>Asus laptops</u></a> to consider.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/asus-chromebook-flip-c302">Asus Chromebook Flip</a>&#xA0;</p>

<p>When Android apps first became available to the best Chromebooks, it was only a matter of time before Samsung throw its hat into the ring, crafting a Chromebook that&#x2019;s not only powerful, but truly beautiful as well. With a 12.3-inch QHD touchscreen and a 360-degree hinge, the Samsung Chromebook Pro also has a built-in stylus, the first of its kind to show up in a Chromebook. This device gives many of its competitors a run for their money &#x2013; that includes most Android devices &#x2013; even if the keyboard could use some tightening up.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-chromebook-pro">Samsung Chromebook Pro</a></p>

<p>When you think of Chromebooks, education is one of the first things that comes to mind. With the Acer Chromebook Spin 13, the Taiwanese company wants its Chromebooks to be synonymous with business as well. Beautifully built from aluminum with a gorgeous QHD screen, it will perfectly fit in any office setting, as well as actually draw some envious looks. It&#x2019;s more than just its attractive chassis, however: the Acer Chromebook Spin 13 is packed with full-fat Ultrabook processors, so you can get work done &#x2013; whether it&#x2019;s at school or in the office &#x2013; in style.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-13-convertible">Acer Chromebook Spin 13</a></p>

<p>The best Chromebooks are inexpensive devices that are accessible to anyone, no matter the budget. And, in that spirit, the Dell Inspiron Chromebook 11 2-in-1 perfectly fits the bill. This isn&#x2019;t the most powerful Chromebook on the market, obviously. However, it boils Chromebooks down to what they need to be: affordable, easy to use and durable.

Whether you&#x2019;re a student or a parent of one, this is a cheap, capable and durable laptop that will let you get some schoolwork done on the go. You might not get any hardcore gaming or proper video editing done on it.

Still, given that the best Chromebooks rolling out this year are fully convertible, thanks to the wide adoption of Android app support, the Acer Chromebook 15 had to prove itself with more than great style. Beyond its aptitude for laying flat using a 180-degree hinge, this beautiful 15-inch Chromebook also makes a great impression with its battery life, lasting nearly 17 hours in our battery test.</p><p><strong>Read the full review:</strong> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/acer-chromebook-15-1277917/review/2#article-body">Acer Chromebook 15</a></p>

<p>We wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to see Acer replacing the Chromebook R11 someday soon &#x2013; at least, judging by the recent release of the Chromebook Spin 11, and owing to the fact that it isn&#x2019;t the most powerful choice out there. Yet it still holds up to this day as among the best Chromebooks on the market, offering full access to Android Apps on the Google Play store. What&#x2019;s more, it does so on a touchscreen display that can be rotated around into tablet mode, fitted in an all-metal finish that you would be proud to show off.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/acer-chromebook-r11-1311770/review/1">Acer Chromebook R11</a></p>

<p>The best Chromebooks are the ones that balance a bargain price and efficient use of Chrome OS &#x2013; and the HP Chromebook 14 is the perfect example of that. While it&#x2019;s similar to the Acer Chromebook 15 in a lot of ways, this 14-inch Chromebook is a tad more compact and looks slightly better. Complemented by a bright blue finish and a screen made to astound, the HP Chromebook 14 offers the best value of any Chromebook out there. Even if the battery life and performance are average &#x2013; the HP Chromebook 14 is easily one of the best Chromebooks to date.</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/hp-chromebook-14-1317787/review">HP Chromebook 14</a></p>

<p>We can easily forgive the Acer Chromebook Spin 15&#x2019;s shortcomings &#x2013; namely, its subpar trackpad and the fact that doesn&#x2019;t take full advantage of the space it has &#x2013; as it more than makes up for them with enough power for formidable multitasking, a battery life that will outlast yours and a beautiful touchscreen that&#x2019;s surprisingly premium for the price. All those certainly warrant this Chromebook a spot in our best Chromebooks list, and that&#x2019;s without even factoring in its affordability.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>2019 might have already welcomed some fantastic cameras from all corners, but we&apos;re sure there&apos;s plenty more to surface before the year is up.</strong></p><p>Key highlights so far include Fujifilm&apos;s monstrous <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fujifilm-gfx-100">GFX 100</a> medium format model, as well as Panasonic&apos;s 6K-ready <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/panasonic-cine-camera-rumors-third-s-series-model-may-be-video-centric">S1H</a> and Canon&apos;s super-affordable <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/canon-eos-rp-review">EOS RP</a>.&#xA0;Sony&apos;s most recent <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/sony-a7r-iv-now-official-worlds-first-mirrorless-camera-with-a-61mp-full-frame-sensor">A7R IV</a> also upped the bar for full-frame mirrorless cameras, packing a mighty impressive 61MP full-frame sensor among other goodies.</p><p>So what happens next? We have an idea of what we expect and some manufacturers have already made it clear where they want to be heading with their various lines. And some rumors just don&apos;t seem to want to go anywhere, even if we get a few curveball releases to throw us off the scent now and again.</p>

<h3>Canon EOS R Pro</h3>

<p><strong>Could we see a pro-spec mirrorless equivalent of the EOS-1D X Mark II? Or will it have a super-high-res sensor to rival the likes of the Sony A7R IV?</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs: </strong>Too early to say | RF Lens mount</p>
<p><img  id="oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>While Canon&apos;s first full-frame mirrorless camera, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/canon-eos-r-review">EOS R</a> is a very good camera, it&apos;s not the flagship many had expected. The subsequent <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/canon-eos-rp-review">EOS RP</a> is a welcome alternative, with a lighter body and a cheaper price tag, but there&apos;s still a huge gap for a camera that either has outright resolution or sports and action as its primary focus.</p><p><a href="https://www.canonrumors.com/flagship-eos-r-camera-coming-in-february-ahead-of-cp-cr1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CanonRumors</a> had previously reported that we could see an EOS R Pro development announcement in January, although this never happened. However, in a recent <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/canon-confirms-pro-level-full-frame-mirrorless-body-is-on-the-way">interview</a>, it confirmed a more senior camera was on the way &#x2013; and since then, the name &apos;Canon EOS Rx&apos; has been bandied around forums and rumor sites.</p><p>We reckon it&apos;ll be a natural successor to the professionals&apos; favorite, the mighty <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/canon-eos-1d-x-mk-ii-1314141/review">Canon EOS-1D X Mark II</a> (though that&apos;s not to say we won&apos;t see a Mark III version as well), with a launch next year enough time to establish itself ahead of the 2020 Olympics.&#xA0;</p><p>The strongest rumors suggest that Canon will focus on resolution first, and that a new pro model will pack a 75MP full-frame sensor, considerably more than the 50MP <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/canon-eos-5ds-1283846/review">EOS 5DS</a> and EOS 5DS R.&#xA0;</p>

<h3>Canon EOS M5 II and EOS M6 II</h3>
<figure><p><img  id="m24FLn6ssjitfkUV4Z8RDD" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e1e178ca0094e56a65c9d93b192a9d84.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>Canon EOS M5</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>It looks like Canon&apos;s oldest current mirrorless cameras are set for an update</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs: </strong>New 24MP APS-C sensors | 4K video recording | DIGIC 8 image processors | 30fps Raw Burst shooting</p>
<p><img  id="x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>While Canon&apos;s been focusing its attention on its new EOS R full-frame mirrorless camera, it doesn&apos;t seem the company&apos;s EOS M range is going anywhere.</p><p>A replacement for the EOS M6, possibly called the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/canon-eos-m6-mark-ii-gets-its-first-set-of-rumored-specs">EOS M6 II</a>, is rumored to be joining the EOS M stable shortly, while an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/canon-eos-m5-mark-ii-rumored-to-launch-alongside-the-eos-m6-mark-ii">EOS M5 II</a> update to the EOS M5 has also been mooted.</p><p>Both models are to be designed around Canon&apos;s 24.2MP APS-C sensors, but we expect both new models to get updated sensors (though resolution is likely to stay the same) that support 4K video recording, hopefully without the restrictive cropping that the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/canon-eos-m50-review">EOS M50</a> suffers from.&#xA0;</p><p>This could mean we could see in DIGIC 8 image processors and improved Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology with better subject tracking.&#xA0;</p><p>Canon&apos;s most recent <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-iii-is-a-4k-shooting-vloggers-delight">PowerShot G7 X Mark III</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/canon-powershot-g5-x-mark-ii-review">G5 X Mark II</a> also received some impressive 30fps Raw Burst shooting options &#x2013; so will we see these here too? Providing the sensors can read out this information as speedily as the 1-inch sensor inside those models, quite possibly.</p>

<h3>Canon EOS 5D X</h3>
<p><img  id="wjML588rQuMAHfropxTgVf" name="" alt="Canon EOS 5D X" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wjML588rQuMAHfropxTgVf.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p><strong>Could Canon launch a rival to Nikon&apos;s D850 and Sony&apos;s Alpha A7R IV?</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs: </strong>Full-frame 50MP sensor | 8fps burst shooting | Improved 4K video capture</p>
<p><img  id="oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>When it was launched back in 2016, Canon&apos;s <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/canon-eos-5d-mark-iv-1326906/review">EOS 5D Mark IV</a> was our favourite DSLR. A well-rounded camera, it was (and still is) an incredibly versatile photographic tool. However, 2017 saw Nikon release the mighty 45.4MP <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/nikon-d850-review">D850</a>, before the 45.7MP <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/nikon-z7-review">Z7</a> last year, while Sony launched the 61MP <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/sony-a7r-iv-now-official-worlds-first-mirrorless-camera-with-a-61mp-full-frame-sensor">Alpha A7R IV</a> earlier this year.&#xA0;</p><p>All of these cameras offer more pixels while matching or bettering the performance of the EOS 5D Mark IV. So, unless you&apos;re a die-hard Canon user and heavily invested in the system, the EOS 5D Mark IV is hard to recommend over the other two.&#xA0;</p><p>Then consider that the 50MP Canon EOS 5DS was launched in 2015 and we reckon Canon might consolidate its two lines into a single, multi-purpose DSLR that offers a high pixel count and high performance to rival the D850 and Alpha A7R IV.</p><p>We&apos;re speculating here, but this new DSLR could potentially be called the EOS 5D X and feature a new and improved 50MP full-frame sensor that was used in the EOS 5DS, now with a much broader and improved ISO range, while burst shooting could hit 8fps.&#xA0;</p><p>We reckon video might also get a hike in performance - the 1.64x crop when shooting 4K on the EOS 5D Mark IV is a bit of a turn off to many videographers. To aid shooting both stills and video, maybe we might also see the inclusion of a vari-angle touchscreen display.</p>

<h3>Canon EOS 7D Mark III</h3>
<p><img  id="LMztsrHi6VDdaVEj9s6e9g" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMztsrHi6VDdaVEj9s6e9g.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p><strong>One of the oldest EOS DSLRs available, could Canon&apos;s high-end enthusiast DSLR be about to get an update?</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs: </strong>Updated 20.2MP sensor or new 28MP chip | Dual DIGIC 8 image processors | 11fps+ burst shooting</p>
<p><img  id="oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Announced back in 2014, the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/canon-7d-mark-ii-1264977/review">EOS 7D Mark II</a> is one of the oldest, if not the oldest DSLR in the EOS line-up and we think 2018 will be the year we see the arrival of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/is-canon-readying-a-32mp-dslr">EOS 7D Mark III</a>.</p><p>What can we expect to see then? It&apos;ll certainly get a new sensor, but whether Canon opts to stick with a 20MP resolution or increase this to 28MP (as <a href="https://www.canonwatch.com/canon-eos-7d-mark-iii-announcement-before-summer-2018-shipment-from-julyaugust-cw4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CanonWatch.com</a> is reporting), it&apos;s still unclear. It&apos;ll definitely get a broader ISO performance to rival the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/nikon-d500-1312621/review">Nikon D500</a>, while a better <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-a-to-z-of-photography-dynamic-range">dynamic range</a> at low ISO sensitivities would be welcome too.&#xA0;</p><p>The dual DIGIC 4 image processors in the Mark II are likely to be replaced by the latest DIGIC 8 image processor, seeing burst shooting speeds increase beyond 10fps - maybe somewhere between 11-12fps. The new image processor could also help out with AF tracking - something the existing model lags behind on compared to its newer rivals.</p><p>The Canon EOS 7D Mark III should also see the inclusion of touchscreen functionality on the rear vari-angle display to real take advantage of Canon&apos;s Dual Pixel CMOS AF system for Live View.&#xA0;</p><p>What about video? Canon&apos;s been reticent to include 4K capture on a string of new cameras with the exception of the EOS 5D Mark IV, but to compete with rivals, the EOS 7D Mark III really needs this feature to compete.&#xA0;</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s possible that Canon will focus elsewhere and will kill off the EOS 7D line, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-canon-eos-7d-dslr-line-has-reportedly-been-scrapped">as has been reported</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon EOS 90D</h3>
<figure><p><img  id="U9ajdsraqS9GnF8uFfiAj5" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5564040a735b2ffd16e5575e0e1a1c38.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p>Canon EOS 80D. Image credit: Canon</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The EOS 80D is now over three years old, and Canon&apos;s mid-range DSLR portfolio could do with a shot in the arm.</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs: </strong>32MP APS-C sensor | Dual DIGIC 8 image processors | 4K video and Dual Pixel CMOS AF</p>
<p><img  id="x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>There have been rumblings of Canon developing a 32MP sensor for some time, and a model like the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/fresh-canon-eos-90d-and-eos-m6-ii-details-leak-out">Canon EOS 90D</a> would be a logical recipient.&#xA0;</p><p>The EOS 80D has been with us since the start of 2016 and while it&apos;s a fine camera for the enthusiast &#x2013; or well-heeled beginner &#x2013; it looks a little dated next to current rivals.</p><p>There&apos;s no 4K video, for example, and the autofocus system is outgunned by Nikon&apos;s offerings. A slightly larger display with a higher resolution would be very welcome when you consider what&apos;s on offer elsewhere too.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/is-the-canon-eos-90d-around-the-corner">Rumored specs</a> include Dual Pixel CMOS AF (a near-certainty), together with weather resistance, 10fps burst shooting and dual SD-type card slots.</p>

<h3>Nikon Z1 or Z3</h3>
<figure><p><img  id="2LrdZ9NsUmyFuYfNhLsKGg" name="" alt="Nikon Z6" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LrdZ9NsUmyFuYfNhLsKGg.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption><p><br></p></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With the full-frame Z6 (above) currently the cheapest model in the Z system, rumors of something even more junior are heating up</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs:</strong> APS-C sensor | Z mount | No 4K video | No viewfinder but tilting LCD</p>
<p><img  id="x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Nikon&apos;s Z system currently has two camera options, and the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/nikon-z6-review">Z6</a> is the most junior of these. That may well have drawn many full-frame DSLR users across to mirrorless for the first time, but if Nikon is to entice a broader audience, a cheaper alternative is would be a sensible idea.</p><p>So, the rumors of a Nikon Z1 or Nikon Z3 that have been with us for some time are starting to look more credible. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/nikon-z1-rumors-grow-with-new-leaked-image">some rumblings</a> of an entry-level model quite recently, but this appeared to us a little more than a convincing Photoshop job.</p><p>The big question is exactly how a new entry-level model will be different from the Z6. It may, for example, maintain a full-frame sensor, although it might be fitted with an APS-C alternative to bring it into a new price category.&#xA0;</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/unannounced-nikon-mirrorless-camera-gets-leaked-in-new-patent-images">Images</a> that were reportedly filed as part of a patent show that Nikon may plan to drop the viewfinder from such a model, which makes sense as it&apos;s not a critical part of a camera and often something that&apos;s omitted from cheaper mirrorless cameras.&#xA0;</p><p>This would also make the model a lot smaller and more attractive to those who want to travel light. Whatever happens, we can&apos;t wait to see where Nikon takes the Z system next.</p>

<h3>Nikon Z9</h3>

<p><strong>We think we could see at flagship Z9 full-frame mirrorless camera before the year is up</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs:</strong> 61MP sensor | Z mount | 6K video recording | 5.76 million-dot viewfinder | Twin card slots</p>
<p><img  id="oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/nikon-z7-review">Nikon Z7</a> is one of our favourite cameras right now, for many reasons. Yet, much like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/canon-eos-r-review">Canon&apos;s EOS R</a>, it&apos;s perhaps not quite the flagship full-frame mirrorless camera many were expecting.&#xA0;</p><p>If we look at <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/sony-a7r-iv-now-official-worlds-first-mirrorless-camera-with-a-61mp-full-frame-sensor">Sony&apos;s A7R IV</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sony-alpha-a9">A9</a> models, for example, and Panasonic&apos;s upcoming <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/panasonic-s1h-6k-full-frame-camera-unveiled-at-cine-gear-expo-2019">S1H</a>, we can see it&apos;s not quite at the top of the tree for pixel count, video specs or burst shooting. And rumors of a more pro-end Z series model, possibly called the Z9 or Z8, have been steadily building as soon as the initial excitement of the Z6 and Z7 had died down a little.</p><p>But will it be a sports-focused camera with a more modest sensor resolution or a megapixel beast? Our money is on the latter for two reasons. First, releasing a camera with an autofocus system that&apos;s on a par with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/sony-a9-finally-gets-its-real-time-tracking-boost-through-v50-firmware">Sony&apos;s Real Time Tracking</a> technology &#x2013; ie, a camera totally at home shooting action &#x2013; is going to take some work. Sony is, after all, on its fourth generation of mirrorless camera, while Nikon&apos;s Z system hasn&apos;t even celebrated its first birthday. &#xA0;</p><p>Some may suspect Nikon will have a suitable sports-focused mirrorless camera in time for the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-tech-powering-the-2020-olympic-games">2020 Olympic Games</a>, but it&apos;s unlikely to have a native lens selection to match before then. So, it&apos;s far more likely that, at least for this particular audience, the company is focusing on bringing this kind of improvement to a DSLR update to the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/nikon-d5-1312739/review">D5</a> &#x2013; and there&apos;s more on what we think of that below.</p><p>Second, with the arrival of the A7R IV, we know a modern 61MP full-frame sensor exists. It&apos;s quite possible that such a model would use a variation of this sensor, given that we know Sony supplies sensors to countless other manufacturers for their own products.</p><p>We reckon a high-resolution Z9 camera would arrive with stronger video specs than the Z6 and Z7, potentially even matching the Panasonic S1H in being capable of shooting 6K footage, although this would also require beefier processing power and better heat dissipation among other things. We&apos;d also love to see the same kind of 5.76 million-dot electronic viewfinder as we have inside the likes of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/panasonic-lumix-s1-review">Panasonic S1</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/panasonic-lumix-s1r-review">S1R</a>, as this is a noticeable step up on the (still very good) 3.69 million-dot finders Nikon fitted its Z6 and Z7. &#xA0;</p>

<p>While the Z6 and Z7 have grabbed the headlines over the last year, we don&apos;t expect Nikon to forget its DSLR heritage.</p><p>Over the last three years or so, the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/nikon-d750-1265199/review"><u>D750</u></a> has become a renowned and inexpensive full-frame choice in Nikon&#x2019;s stable, but it could really use an update to compete with a number of more recent full-frame offerings.</p><p>With the arrival of the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/nikon-d850-review">D850</a> with an impressive 45.4MP resolution, could we see the D760 make use of the 36.3MP sensor found in the outgoing <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/nikon-d810-1254883/review">D810</a> and replace the current 24MP chip?&#xA0;Or could it get the same 24.5MP sensor as the Z6?</p><p>The D750&#x2019;s maximum 1/4,000sec shutter speed is an understandable compromise to help it to be more reasonably priced, but a compromise regardless. A high shutter speed of 1/8000sec might be on the cards then.&#xA0;</p><p>It wouldn&#x2019;t be likely that such a camera would launch without 4K video recording, especially after the 4K-enabled <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/nikon-d500-1312621/review">D500</a>, D850 and D5. It&#x2019;s also likely that it will have a tilting display like the D750, but Nikon would probably add touchscreen control too. Finally, don&apos;t forget Nikon will introduce its SnapBridge connectivity as well.</p>

<h3>Nikon D6</h3>

<p><strong>Nikon&apos;s flagship DSLR could get a midlife tweak</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs:</strong> Full-frame 20MP sensor | New EXPEED image processor| 14fps burst shooting</p>

<p>Nikon launched the D5 back at CES in 2016, and rather than seeing a &apos;S&apos; update that Nikon tends to do with its flagship camera every two years, we think Nikon might skip this and release an all-new D6 model. &#xA0;</p><p>So what are we likely to see? That&apos;s hard to say at the moment, but NikonRumors.com stated last year that <a href="https://nikonrumors.com/2018/11/27/nikon-d6-coming-soon.aspx/" target="_blank">the D6 would be available for testing in February</a> of this year.&#xA0;</p><p>We think the resolution should remain the same at 20MP, but a new EXPEED image processor could bring a number of improvements - we can&apos;t imagine Nikon would be able to extend the maximum ISO range of ISO3,280,000 found on the D5, but the improved processing power should see improved noise handling. &#xA0;</p><p>Burst shooting could also be boosted slightly - the D5 can shoot at 12fps with full AF and metering, so we could see a performance bump to 13 or 14fps.&#xA0;</p><p>While the 153-point AF system in the D5 is perhaps the most advanced autofocus systems going, we expect Nikon to improve on this even further.&#xA0;We might also see some very subtle tweaks to the handling as well, but we shouldn&apos;t see a huge shift in button placement.&#xA0;</p>

<p><strong>Lots of new lenses for the Z-series cameras are due this year</strong></p><p><strong>What we know: </strong>At least four more lenses this year and three in 2020.</p>
<p>As with any manufacturer that has just launched a new camera system, Nikon&apos;s main challenge now is to introduce many new compatible lenses &#x2013; and fast.</p><p>The company has already released optics that cover some of the most popular focal length/aperture combinations, such as the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/nikon-confirms-nikkor-z-24-70mm-f28-s-for-its-z-system"> Z 24&#x2013;70mm f/2.8 S</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/nikon-goes-long-with-its-portrait-friendly-nikkor-z-85mm-f18-s">Z 85mm f/1.8 S</a> and Z 50mm F1.8 S, and this year will also welcome a 24mm f/1.8 lens that was initially scheduled for a 2020 release.&#xA0;</p><p>We&apos;ll also be getting the 70-200mm f/2.8 optic, together with the beefy, manual-focus <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/we-could-see-nikons-ultra-fast-58mm-f095-prime-in-january">58mm f/0.95 Noct</a> that was announced at the very start of the series.</p><p>Next year, Nikon plans to release 20mm f/1.8, 50mm f/1.2 and a 14-28mm f/2.8 lenses among others, and has already started showing off mockups at various shows.&#xA0;</p>

<h3>Sony Alpha A7S III</h3>
<p><img  id="sRNKmYTECMBBmiE9B36cFF" name="" alt="Sony A7S II" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRNKmYTECMBBmiE9B36cFF.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p><strong>Rumors of an A7S III, and update to Sony&apos;s video-focused full-frame mirrorless A7S II camera, continue to grow</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs: </strong>20MP+ sensor allowing for 6K video | Joystick AF control | Z-series battery</p>
<p><img  id="oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Is there a camera more anticipated than the Sony A7S III? The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/sony-a7s-ii-1304138/review">Alpha A7S II</a> broke new ground at the time of its release, appealing to videographers who required excellent 4K footage and high-level control, together with low-light shooters who appreciated the more modest pixel count, low noise and wide dynamic range not offered by other mirrorless cameras at the time.</p><p>Since its release, Sony has given us all manner of other mirrorless Alpha models, from the enthusiast-focused <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sony-alpha-a6400-review">A6400</a> through to the hugely popular (and rightly so) <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a7-iii-review">Alpha A7 III</a> and the most recent 61MP <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/sony-a7r-iv-now-official-worlds-first-mirrorless-camera-with-a-61mp-full-frame-sensor">Alpha A7R IV</a>. The latter marks the start of the fourth generation of A7 models &#x2013; so how come we&apos;re still on the Mark II here?</p><p>There&apos;s clearly massive demand for one, and we can predict many specs and features from those in models released since the A7S II. We don&apos;t see any call for a sensor resolution beyond 12MP, although if the camera breaks into 6K video recording &#x2013; as Panasonic&apos;s upcoming <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/panasonic-s1h-6k-full-frame-camera-unveiled-at-cine-gear-expo-2019">S1H</a> will &#x2013; it will need 20MP at the very least.</p><p>Even if the model is capped at 4K video recording, we do expect a new sensor that performs to a higher standard than before, given the company&apos;s expertise in sensor design and build.</p><p>Handling refinements will no doubt include a dedicated AF joystick, AF-On button and touchscreen interface, all missing from the A7S II but introduced in subsequent models. The model is also highly likely to get a Z-series battery with much higher battery life than the NP-FW50 found inside the A7S II.</p><p>The biggest improvements should be seen in video performance. With Panasonic&apos;s Lumix <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-gh5s">GH5S</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/panasonic-lumix-s1r">S1R</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/panasonic-lumix-s1-review">S1</a> models offering a wealth of advanced video features, we&apos;d be disappointed if Sony didn&apos;t match or better these. The Alpha A7S II can record 4K 4:2:0 8-bit video, but could we see this increase to 4:2:2 10-bit like the GH5S? Could we see 4K capture at 60/50p possible as well? It would be surprising if not.</p>

<h3>Sony Alpha A7000</h3>

<p><strong>With the A6400 now with us, what might a more senior A7000 bring to the mirrorless party?</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs:</strong> 26MP APS-C sensor | Improved AF | Design similar to the Alpha A9</p>
<p><img  id="oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyYK5qmxghsTkZPPmJ3DbK.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>Sony has shown full-frame users a lot of attention in recent years, and this has left its A6000-series looking a little unloved. The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/sony-alpha-a6000-1223772/review">A6000</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a6300-review">A6300</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a6500">A6500</a> can all still be bought brand new, as as each camera had a solid set of specs to begin with, all three are still a respectable choices in their price categories.</p><p>The company finally showed the line some love with the most recent A6400, which technically replaces the A6300 and has a very capable performance to recommend it, but it&apos;s fair to say it wasn&apos;t quite the A7000 that everyone was hoping for. So what might the A7000 feature?</p><p>A &apos;baby&apos; <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sony-alpha-a9"><u>Alpha A9</u></a>, with the A7000 camera borrowing many of the features of the flagship camera that would then be distilled into a camera based around an APS-C sensor. This is something that Nikon has done with its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/nikon-d5-1312739/review">D5</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/nikon-d500-1312621/review">D500</a> DSLR models.</p><p>Rumors suggest that it matches and in some aspects exceeds the performance of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fujifilm-x-t3">Fujifilm X-T3</a>, with better AF and in-body image stabilization, while it will match the 20fps burst shooting speed of the Alpha A9.</p><p>As for the sensor, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/chances-are-these-sony-sensors-are-in-your-new-camera"><u>Sony&apos;s just updated the database of sensors it manufactures</u></a>, which includes a back-illuminated (BSI) 26MP APS-C sensor, which would be a good fit for the new camera.&#xA0;There&apos;s also talk of the Alpha A7000 using a 32MP APS-C sensor as well.&#xA0;</p><p>Sony has made great changes to its autofocusing systems in recent generations of camera too, and while the 425-point phase-detect AF system inside the A6500 is still a cracking performer, the eventual update will likely bring speed improvements and additional AF points to form a denser array, with better tracking capabilities.</p><p>Design-wise, it&apos;s likely the new camera will feature a similar DSLR inspired look to Sony&apos;s full-frame cameras, with a raised and centralised electronic viewfinder.</p>

<h3>Fujifilm X-Pro3</h3>

<p><strong>The X-T2 got a new sibling in the X-T3, so where&apos;s the X-Pro2&apos;s update?&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs:</strong> 26.1MP back-illuminated X-Trans CMOS sensor | X-Processor 4 | Even better AF with eye detection&#xA0;</p>
<p><img  id="x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>The X-Pro3 is perhaps the most anticipated camera from Fujifilm right now. The fact that it&apos;s been with us for quite some time, and the recent updates to the X-T series in the shape of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fujifilm-x-t100">X-T100</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fujifilm-x-t30-review">X-T30</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/fujifilm-x-t3">X-T3</a>, mean that a switch in focus back to the X-Pro line would be as logical as it would be welcome.</p><p>While Fujifilm has kept the model fresh through a slew of firmware updates, these can&apos;t address the hardware side of things. So we expect the latest 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and X-Processor Pro engine, together with boosts to the autofocus system and burst rate at the very least.&#xA0;</p><p>We&apos;d also love to see Fujifilm drop the ISO dial within the shutter speed dial as it&apos;s just too fiddly, and it would be welcome to have a tilting rear display, although Fujifilm does need to keep the line different from the X-T range, whose models offer this.&#xA0;</p><p>When will it show up? The strongest rumors right now claim the model will be announced later this year, around September or October, and that it&apos;s already been registered for wireless communication (which is standard for upcoming models, albeit under a code name).</p>

<p><strong>With the arrival of the X-T3 and the medium-format GFX models, the X-H1 is looking a little outdated.</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs:</strong> 26.1MP back-illuminated X-Trans CMOS sensor | X-Processor 4 | Vastly improved AF system with stronger Face and Eye detection</p>
<p><img  id="x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6a9KSnvLiFgwihQYRQr28.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p>
<p>The X-H1 might still hold a handful of charms over its X-series siblings &#x2013; sensor-based image stabilization, for example, and better support for longer and heavier lenses &#x2013; but it&apos;s really starting to show its age now.</p><p>Time for a reboot? We think it&apos;s worth Fujifilm giving an X-H2 it a shot, particularly when you consider the wealth of technology that&apos;s been gifted to all the Fujifilm cameras that have arrived since the X-H1 was launched.</p><p>So, a newer sensor and processing partnership, stronger autofocus with the same improvements to face and eye detection, and maybe even a viewfinder more in line with the 5.76 million-dot beauty we saw inside the GFX 100?</p><p>It could be the case that the X-H1 was too niche a camera to attract too much love, and with the X-T line recently updated and the GFX series to populate, there&apos;s not enough call for a model between the two. We still think the X-H1 is a great camera &#x2013; but we&apos;d love to see what Fujifilm could do with a sequel.&#xA0;</p>

<p><strong>The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is the odd one out in the OM-D range, so can we expect an update soon?</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs:</strong> 20MP Micro Four Thirds sensor | Core features to remain the same | 4K video</p>

<p>We&apos;ve seen updates in the shape of the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-ii">OM-D E-M1 Mark II</a> and <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m10-mark-iii-review">OM-D E-M10 Mark III</a>, which just leaves the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/olympus-om-d-e-m5-mark-ii-1284458/review">OM-D E-M5 Mark II</a> to get refreshed in the OM-D series.</p><p>We think that for this enthusiast mirrorless camera, Olympus will ditch the 16MP Micro Four Thirds sensor and replace it with the 20MP chip used by the OM-D E-M1 Mark II. The fact that company opted to use a 20MP sensor in its most recent <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m1x">OM-D E-M1X</a> model lends further support to this idea.&#xA0;</p><p>We&apos;d expect to see 4K video capture and maybe the excellent 5-axis image stabilization get a tweak to deliver 7-stop compensation like the OM-D E-M1X. Focusing could also get a bump up to 121 points.</p>

<p><strong>A sizeable collection of lenses to support the new S1R and S1 cameras is on its way</strong></p><p><strong>Predicted specs:</strong> At least ten new lenses released throughout 2020</p>

<p>Having just launched the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/panasonic-lumix-s1r">S1R and S1</a>, two full-frame mirrorless cameras in a brand new S system, and then followed it up by the 6K-capable <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/panasonic-s1h-6k-full-frame-camera-unveiled-at-cine-gear-expo-2019">S1H</a>, Panasonic is entitled to lay low for a while. Yet, the promise of ten new lenses to be released before the year is up shows there&apos;s little chance of that happening.</p><p>The company has already confirmed the Lumix S 24-105mm f/4 Macro O.I.S, S PRO 50mm f/1.4 and S PRO 70-200mm f/4 O.I.S optics, but a roadmap shown at the S1R/S1 launch reveals that it will focus its attention on 24-70mm f/2.8, 70-200mm f/2.8 and 16-35mm f/4 options. The promise of at least seven further lenses on top of that leaves plenty of space for interesting primes, potentially some with particularly wide apertures.</p><p>1.4x and 2x teleconverters are also set to arrive at some point in the year and 2020 should bring two fixed-focal length lenses in addition to a macro and super telephoto optic. This system may just be getting started, but knowing how prolific Panasonic has been with its G series cameras gives us plenty of hope that it will flourish in little time.&#xA0;</p>
