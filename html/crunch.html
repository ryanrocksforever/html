<p>Other than Twitter, TrustBridge Partners, and existing investors Shunwei Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, SAIF Capital, India Quotient and Morningside Venture Capital also participated in the Series D round of ShareChat.</p>
<p>The new round, which pushes ShareChat’s all-time raise to $224 million, valued the firm at about $650 million, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. ShareChat declined to comment on the valuation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twitter and ShareChat are aligned on the broader purpose of serving the public conversation, helping the world learn faster and solve common challenges. This investment will help ShareChat grow and provide the company’s management team access to Twitter’s executives as thought partners,” said Manish Maheshwari, managing director of Twitter India, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Twitter, like many other Silicon Valley firms, counts India as one of its key markets. And like Twitter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/facebook-meesho-first-indian-startup-investment/">other Silicon Valley firms</a> are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/28/india-shuttl/">increasingly investing</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/04/reliance-industries-fynd/">Indian startups</a>.</p>
<p>ShareChat serves 60 million users each month in 15 regional languages, Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and CEO of the firm, told TechCrunch in an interview. The platform currently does not support English, and has no plans to change that, Sachdeva said.</p>
<p>That choice is what has driven users to ShareChat, he explained. The early incarnation of the social media platform supported English language. It saw most of its users choose English as their preferred language, but this also led to another interesting development: Their engagement with the app significantly reduced.</p>
<h2>The origin story</h2>
<p>“For some reason, everyone wanted to converse in English. There was an inherent bias to pick English even when they did not know it.” (Only about 10% of India&#8217;s 1.3 billion people speak English. Hindi, a regional language, on the other hand, is spoken by about half a billion people, according to official government figures.)</p>
<p>So ShareChat pulled support for English. Today, an average user spends 22 minutes on the app each day, Sachdeva said. The learning in the early days to remove English is just one of the many things that has shaped ShareChat to what it is today and led to its growth.</p>
<p>In 2014, Sachdeva and two of his friends &#8212; Bhanu Singh and Farid Ahsan, all of whom met at the prestigious institute IIT Kanpur &#8212; got the idea of building a debate platform by looking at the kind of discussions people were having on Facebook groups.</p>
<p>They identified that cricket and movie stars were popular conversation topics, so they created WhatsApp groups and aggressively posted links to those groups on Facebook to attract users.</p>
<p>It was then when they built chatbots to allow users to discover different genres of jokes, recommendations for phones and food recipes, among other things. But they soon realized that users weren’t interested in most of such offerings.</p>
<p>“Nobody cared about our smartphone recommendations. All they wanted was to download wallpapers, ringtones, copy jokes and move on. They just wanted content.”</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone wp-image-1869492" title="sharechat_team" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sharechat_team.jpg" alt="sharechat team" width="901" height="602" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sharechat_team.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sharechat_team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sharechat_team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sharechat_team.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sharechat_team.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sharechat_team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>
<p>So in 2015, Sachdeva and company moved on from chatbots and created an app where users can easily produce, discover and share content in the languages they understand. (Today, user generated content is one of the key attractions of the platform, with about 15% of its user base actively producing content.)</p>
<p>A year later, ShareChat, like tens of thousands of other businesses, was in for a pleasant surprise. India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, launched his new telecom network Reliance Jio, which offered users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/reliance-jio-broadband-blockchain-iot-microsoft/">access to the bulk of data at little to no charge for an extended period of time</a>.</p>
<p>This immediately changed the way millions of people in the country, who once cared about each megabyte they consumed online, interacted with the internet. On ShareChat people quickly started to move from sharing jokes and other messages in text format to images and then videos.</p>
<h2>Path ahead and monetization</h2>
<p>That momentum continues to today. ShareChat now plans to give users more incentive &#8212; including money &#8212; and tools to produce content on the platform to drive engagement. &#8220;There remains a huge hunger for content in vernacular languages,&#8221; Sachdeva said.</p>
<p>Speaking of money, ShareChat has experimented with ads on the app and its site, but revenue generation isn&#8217;t currently its primary focus, Sachdeva said. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the Series D now so there is obviously an obligation we have to our investors to make money. But we all believe that we need to focus on growth at this stage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>ShareChat, which is headquartered in Bangalore, also has many users in Bangladesh, Nepal and the Middle East, where many users speak Indian regional languages. But the startup currently plans to focus largely on expanding its user base in India, hopefully doubling it in the next one year, he said.</p>
<p>It will use the new capital to strengthen the technology infrastructure and hire more tech talent. Sachdeva said ShareChat is looking to open an office in San Francisco to hire local engineers there.</p>
<p>A handful of local and global giants have emerged in India in recent years to cater to people in small cities and villages, who are just getting online. Pratilipi, a storytelling platform has amassed more than 5 million users, for instance. It recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/pratilipi-a-youtube-for-writers-storytelling-platform-in-india-raises-15-million/">raised $15 million to expand its user base</a> and help users strike deals with content studios.</p>
<p>Perhaps no other app poses a bigger challenge to ShareChat than TikTok, an app where users share short-form videos. TikTok, owned by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/chinas-bytedance-leapfrogs-uber-to-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-startup/"> one of the world&#8217;s most valued startups</a>, has over 120 million users in India and sees content in many Indian languages.</p>
<p>But the app &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/tiktok-bytedance-music-app/">its ever growing ambitions</a> &#8212; also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/indian-court-lifts-ban-on-tiktok-in-india/">tends to land itself in hot water</a> in India <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tiktok-india-hate-speech-caste">every few weeks</a>. In all <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614147/a-teen-video-app-is-the-latest-battlefield-in-the-kashmir-conflict-tiktok-article-370/">sensitive corners of the country</a>. On that front, ShareChat has an advantage. Over the years, it has emerged as an outlier in the country that has strongly supported proposed laws by the Indian government that seek to make social apps more accountable for content that circulates on their platforms.</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is suing virtualization software company <a href="https://corellium.com/">Corellium</a>, according to documents filed today in Florida.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/corellium" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="corellium">Corellium <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> allows customers to create and interact with virtual iOS devices — a software iPhone, for example, running actual iOS firmware, all within the browser. Apple says this is copyright infringement, and is demanding Corellium stops &#8220;all uses of&#8221; its iOS virtualization products and pays Apple unspecified &#8220;damages and lost profits&#8221;</p>
<p>Corellium could allow, for example, a security researcher to quickly fire up a simulated iPhone and hunt for potential bugs. If one is discovered, they can quickly load up prior versions of iOS to see how long this bug has been around. If a bug &#8220;bricks&#8221; the virtual iOS device and renders it unusable, it&#8217;s a matter of just booting up a new one rather than obtaining a whole new phone. Virtualized devices can be paused, giving researchers a detailed look at its precise state at any given moment .</p>
<p>Forbes did a deep dive on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/02/15/corellium-virtual-apple-iphones-for-hacking/#226dbc244a3b">the company last year</a>. As they point out, two of the company&#8217;s co-founders were some of the earliest members of the iPhone jailbreak scene, giving them an understanding better than nearly anyone else in the world as to how iPhones, iPads, etc work under the hood.</p>
<p>In its complaint, Apple writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The product Corellium offers is a “virtual” version of Apple mobile hardware products, accessible to anyone with a web browser. Specifically, Corellium serves up what it touts as a perfect digital facsimile of a broad range of Apple’s market-leading devices—recreating with fastidious attention to detail not just the way the operating system and applications appear visually to bona fide purchasers, but also the underlying computer code. Corellium does so with no license or permission from Apple. </p></blockquote>
<p>This news comes just days after Apple announced that it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/08/apple-hackers-macos-security/">launching a &#8220;iOS Security Research Device Program&#8221;</a>, in which select security researchers would be given access to less-locked down iOS devices in order to help them find vulnerabilities.</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Domestic abuse comes in digital forms as well as physical and emotional, but a lack of tools to address this kind of behavior leaves many victims unprotected and desperate for help. <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/08/new-tools-help-detect-digital-domestic-abuse">This Cornell project aims to define and detect digital abuse in a systematic way</a>.</p>
<p>Digital abuse may be many things: hacking the victim&#8217;s computer, using knowledge of passwords or personal date to impersonate them or interfere with their presence online, accessing photos to track their location, and so on. As with other forms of abuse, there are as many patterns as there are people who suffer from it.</p>
<p>But with something like emotional abuse, there are decades of studies and clinical approaches to address how to categorize and cope with it. Not so with newer phenomena like being hacked or stalked via social media. That means there&#8217;s little standard playbook for them, and both abused and those helping them are left scrambling for answers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to this work, people were reporting that the abusers were very sophisticated hackers, and clients were receiving inconsistent advice. Some people were saying, &#8216;Throw your device out.&#8217; Other people were saying, &#8216;Delete the app.&#8217; But there wasn’t a clear understanding of how this abuse was happening and why it was happening,&#8221; explained Diana Freed, a doctoral student at Cornell Tech and co-author of a new paper about digital abuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were making their best efforts, but there was no uniform way to address this,&#8221; said co-author Sam Havron. &#8220;They were using Google to try to help clients with their abuse situations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investigating this problem with the help of a National Science Foundation grant to examine the role of tech in domestic abuse, they and some professor collaborators at Cornell and NYU came up with a new approach.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a standardized questionnaire to characterize the type of tech-based being experienced. It may not occur to someone who isn&#8217;t tech-savvy that their partner may know their passwords, or that there are social media settings they can use to prevent that partner from seeing their posts. This information and other data are added to a sort of digital presence diagram the team calls the &#8220;technograph&#8221; and which helps the victim visualize their technological assets and exposure.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter wp-image-1869477 size-full" title="technograph_filled" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/technograph_filled.png" alt="technograph filled" width="1024" height="791" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/technograph_filled.png 2200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/technograph_filled.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/technograph_filled.png?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/technograph_filled.png?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/technograph_filled.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/technograph_filled.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The team also created a device they call the IPV Spyware Discovery, or ISDi. It&#8217;s basically spyware scanning software loaded on a device that can check the victim&#8217;s device without having to install anything. This is important because an abuser may have installed tracking software that would alert them if the victim is trying to remove it. Sound extreme? Not to people fighting a custody battle who can&#8217;t seem to escape the all-seeing eye of an abusive ex. And these spying tools are readily available for purchase.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s consistent, it&#8217;s data-driven and it takes into account at each phase what the abuser will know if the client makes changes. This is giving people a more accurate way to make decisions and providing them with a comprehensive understanding of how things are happening,&#8221; explained Freed.</p>
<p>Even if the abuse can&#8217;t be instantly counteracted, it can be helpful simply to understand it and know that there are some steps that can be taken to help.</p>
<p>The authors have been piloting their work at New York&#8217;s Family Justice Centers, and following some testing have <a href="https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/resources">released the complete set of documents and tools for anyone to use</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the team&#8217;s first piece of work on the topic — you can read their other papers and learn more about their ongoing research at the <a href="https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/">Intimate Partner Violence Tech Research program site</a>.</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not every co-founder is acknowledged at the companies that they help to launch. Sometimes, they quit or they&#8217;re elbowed out. Often, they&#8217;re conveniently written out of the company&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>In the case of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cloudflare">Cloudflare, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a third co-founder who began the company with its higher-profile CEO, Matthew Prince, and its COO, Michelle Zatlyn, is little known outside <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the company for a very different reason. As Cloudflare states in an </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477333/000119312519222176/d735023ds1.htm">S-1</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> IPO filing that it made public today, “Tragically, Lee stepped down from Cloudflare in 2015, suffering the debilitating effects of Frontotemporal Dementia, a rare neurological disease.”</span></p>
<p>Frontotemporal dementia impacts between 50,000 and 60,000 Americans, according to a rough estimate cited by the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association, and it tends to impact younger people, often beginning in their 40s.</p>
<p>Though the cause isn&#8217;t known, a person&#8217;s risk for developing frontotemporal dementia &#8212; wherein the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain shrink &#8212; is higher if there&#8217;s a family history of dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>Cloudflare did not respond today to questions about Holloway, but Prince and Zatlyn, in a section of the filing addressed to potential shareholders, credit Holloway as the &#8220;genius who architected our platform and recruited and led our early technical team.&#8221; In fact, they write, when picking a code name for the company&#8217;s IPO, they chose “Project Holloway” to honor his contribution, because the &#8220;technical decisions Lee made, and the engineering team he built, are fundamental to the business we have become.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holloway&#8217;s beneficiaries will be rewarded for that work. According to the S-1, trusts affiliated with him own 18% of the company&#8217;s Series A shares (or common shares) and 3.2% of the company&#8217;s total outstanding shares. Prince meanwhile owns 20.2% of the company’s class B shares and 16.6% of all outstanding shares, and Zatlyn has 6.8% of the company&#8217;s class B shares and 5.6% of the overall shares outstanding.</p>
<p>If Cloudflare goes public at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/cloudflare-files-for-initial-public-offering/">$3.2 billion valuation</a> that it was last assigned by its private investors, Holloway&#8217;s family and other trust recipients could see upwards of $100 million.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s none too shabby for a computer geek who attended Monte Vista High School in Danville, Calif., before working as an engineer at the bubble-era home improvement site HomeWarehouse.com. Its assets were sold in 2000 to Walmart.com in an apparent fire sale; at the time, then-CEO Jeanne Jackson <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Wal-Mart-makes-Net-tech-deal-3054113.php">told the San Francisco Chronicle</a> that Walmart was &#8220;very impressed with the commerce platform developed by the Homewarehouse.com team.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that experience, Holloway headed to UC Santa Cruz, where he studied computer science and, in a meeting that would change his life, was introduced through a professor to Prince with whom he began building an anti-spam startup called Unspam Technologies. Holloway was its chief software architect; Prince continues to <a href="https://www.unspam.com/about.html?section=management">serve as chairman</a>.</p>
<p>The two also co-created Project Honey Pot, an open-source community that still tracks online fraud and abuse.</p>
<p>Zatlyn would enter the picture soon after.</p>
<p>According to Cloudflare itself, in 2009, Prince had taken a sabbatical from work to get his MBA from Harvard Business School. It was when he began telling Zatlyn, a classmate, about Project Honey Pot and its community of users that she helped him recognize a related opportunity in not just tracking internet threats but also stopping them.</p>
<p>While they worked on the business plan as part of their studies, Holloway built the first working prototype. It worked well enough that by 2010, they were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/cloudflare-startup-battlefield-demo-at-disrupt-sf-2010/">pitching investors</a> at a TechCrunch Disrupt as one of the event&#8217;s &#8220;battlefield&#8221; participants.</p>
<p>Holloway wasn&#8217;t onstage for that demonstration. He might have preferred to operate in the background given the nature of his work.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the first of just three tweets he has ever published, he wrote simply, &#8220;Pondering the nature of web exploits.&#8221;</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When someone says &#8220;robotic exoskeleton,&#8221; the power loaders from Aliens are what come to mind for most people (or at least me), but the real things will be much different: softer, smarter and used for much more ordinary tasks. The latest such exo from Harvard is so low-profile you could wear it around the house.</p>
<p><a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/suit-up-with-a-robot-to-walk-and-run-more-easily/">Designed by researchers at Harvard&#8217;s Wyss Institute</a> (in collaboration with several other institutions), which focuses on soft robotics and bio-inspired mechanisms, the exosuit isn&#8217;t for heavy lifting or combating xenomorphs, but simply walking and running a little bit more easily.</p>
<p>The suit, which is really more of a pair of shorts with a mechanism attached at the lower back and cables going to straps on the legs, is intended to simply assist the leg in its hip-extension movement, common to most forms of locomotion.</p>
<p>An onboard computer (and neural network, naturally) detects the movements of the wearer&#8217;s body and determines both the type of gait (walking or running) and what phase of that gait the leg is currently in. It gives the leg making the movement a little boost, making it just that much easier to do it.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/348390281" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>In testing, the suit reduced the metabolic load of walking by 9.3% and running by 4%. That might not sound like much, but they weren&#8217;t looking to create an Olympic-quality cyborg — just show reliable gains from a soft, portable exosuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the metabolic reductions we found are modest, our study demonstrates that it is possible to have a portable wearable robot assist more than just a single activity, helping to pave the way for these systems to become ubiquitous in our lives,&#8221; <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/suit-up-with-a-robot-to-walk-and-run-more-easily/">said lead study author Conor Walsh in a news release</a>.</p>
<p>The whole idea, then, is to leave behind the idea of an exosuit as a big mechanical thing for heavy industry or work, and bring in the idea that one could help an elderly person stand up from a chair, or someone recovering from an accident walk farther without fatigue.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1869414" title="rt_scitoc_aug16_r1" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rt_scitoc_aug16_r1.jpg" alt="rt scitoc aug16 r1" width="1024" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rt_scitoc_aug16_r1.jpg 1158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rt_scitoc_aug16_r1.jpg?resize=150,55 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rt_scitoc_aug16_r1.jpg?resize=300,109 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rt_scitoc_aug16_r1.jpg?resize=768,280 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rt_scitoc_aug16_r1.jpg?resize=680,248 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rt_scitoc_aug16_r1.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The whole device, shorts and all, weighs about 5 kilograms, or 11 pounds. Most of that is in the little battery and motor pack stashed at the top of the shorts, near the body&#8217;s center of mass, helping it feel lighter than it is.</p>
<p>Of course, this is the kind of thing the military is very interested in — not just for active duty (a soldier who can run twice as far or fast) but for treatment of the wounded. So it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that this came out of a DARPA project initiated years ago (and ongoing in other forms).</p>
<p>But by far the more promising applications are civilian, in the medical field and beyond. &#8220;We are excited to continue to apply it to a range of applications, including assisting those with gait impairments, industry workers at risk of injury performing physically strenuous tasks, or recreational weekend warriors,&#8221; said Walsh.</p>
<p>Currently the team is hard at work improving the robo-shorts, reducing the weight, making the assistance more powerful and more intuitive and so on. The paper describing their system was <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6454/668">the cover story of this week&#8217;s edition of the journal Science</a>.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Every time we binge on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> or install a new internet-connected doorbell to our home, we’re adding to a tidal wave of data. In just 10 years, bandwidth consumption has increased 100 fold, and it will only grow as we layer on the demands of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, robotics and self-driving cars. According to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/intel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="intel">Intel, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a single robo car <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/self-driving-cars-big-meaning-behind-one-number-4-terabytes/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/self-driving-cars-big-meaning-behind-one-number-4-terabytes/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1561234087356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmFj212atq1pZrdhQdFkbdS03jZg">will generate</a> 4 terabytes of data in 90 minutes of driving. That’s more than 3 billion times the amount of data people use chatting, watching videos and engaging in other internet pastimes over a similar period.</p>
<p>Tech companies have responded by building massive data centers full of servers. But growth in data consumption is outpacing even the most ambitious infrastructure build outs. The bottom line: We’re not going to meet the increasing demand for data processing by relying on the same technology that got us here.</p>
<p>The key to data processing is, of course, semiconductors, the transistor-filled chips that power today’s computing industry. For the last several decades, engineers have been able to squeeze more and more transistors onto smaller and smaller silicon wafers — an Intel chip today now squeezes more than 1 billion transistors on a millimeter-sized piece of silicon.</p>
<p>This trend is commonly known as Moore’s Law, for the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and his famous 1965 observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every year (later revised to every two years), thereby doubling the speed and capability of computers.</p>
<p>This exponential growth of power on ever-smaller chips has reliably driven our technology for the past 50 years or so. But Moore’s Law is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601441/moores-law-is-dead-now-what/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601441/moores-law-is-dead-now-what/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1561234087356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHazE0ObOCcYf8eD-dlr8g9vhSGCA">coming to an end</a>, due to an even more immutable law: material physics. It simply isn’t possible to squeeze more transistors onto the tiny silicon wafers that make up today’s processors.</p>
<p>Compounding matters, the general-purpose chip architecture in wide use today, known as x86, which has brought us to this point, isn’t optimized for computing applications that are now becoming popular.</p>
<p>That means we need a new computing architecture. Or, more likely, multiple new computer architectures. In fact, I predict that over the next few years we will see a flowering of new silicon architectures and designs that are built and optimized for specialized functions, including data intensity, the performance needs of artificial intelligence and machine learning and the low-power needs of so-called edge computing devices.</p>
<h2>The new architects</h2>
<p>We’re already seeing the roots of these newly specialized architectures on several fronts. These include Graphic Processing Units from Nvidia, Field Programmable Gate Arrays from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/xilinx" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="xilinx">Xilinx <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Altera (acquired by Intel), smart network interface cards from Mellanox (acquired by Nvidia) and a new category of programmable processor called a Data Processing Unit (DPU) from Fungible, a startup Mayfield invested in.  DPUs are purpose-built to run all data-intensive workloads (networking, security, storage) and Fungible combines it with a full-stack platform for cloud data centers that works alongside the old workhorse CPU.</p>
<p>These and other purpose-designed silicon will become the engines for one or more workload-specific applications — everything from security to smart doorbells to driverless cars to data centers. And there will be new players in the market to drive these innovations and adoptions. In fact, over the next five years, I believe we’ll see entirely new semiconductor leaders emerge as these services grow and their performance becomes more critical.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the computing powerhouses of our increasingly connected age: data centers.</p>
<p>More and more, storage and computing are being done at the edge; that means, closer to where our devices need them. These include things like the facial recognition software in our doorbells or in-cloud gaming that’s rendered on our VR goggles. Edge computing allows these and other processes to happen within <a href="https://datacenterfrontier.com/edge-computing-data-centers/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://datacenterfrontier.com/edge-computing-data-centers/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1561234087356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSyppFQHTgUIipp7s-pqUxDilyRQ">10 milliseconds</a> or less, which makes them more work for end users.</p>
<p> <div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
    <blockquote>
      I commend the entrepreneurs who are putting the silicon back into Silicon Valley.           </blockquote>
  </div>
  </p>
<p>With the current arithmetic computations of x86 CPU architecture, deploying data services at scale, or at larger volumes, can be a challenge. Driverless cars need massive, data-center-level agility and speed. You don’t want a car buffering when a pedestrian is in the crosswalk. As our workload infrastructure — and the needs of things like driverless cars — becomes ever more data-centric (storing, retrieving and moving large data sets across machines), it requires a new kind of microprocessor.</p>
<p>Another area that requires new processing architectures is artificial intelligence, both in training AI and running inference (the process AI uses to infer things about data, like a smart doorbell recognizing the difference between an in-law and an intruder). Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which were originally developed to handle gaming, have proven faster and more efficient at AI training and inference than traditional CPUs.</p>
<p>But in order to process AI workloads (both training and inference), for image classification, object detection, facial recognition and driverless cars, we will need specialized AI processors. The math needed to run these algorithms requires vector processing and floating-point computations at dramatically higher performance than general purpose CPUs provide.</p>
<p>Several startups are working on AI-specific chips, including SambaNova, Graphcore and Habana Labs. These companies have built new AI-specific chips for machine intelligence. They lower the cost of accelerating AI applications and dramatically increase performance. Conveniently, they also provide a software platform for use with their hardware. Of course, the big AI players like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (with its <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/google-open-sources-ai-image-segmentation-models-optimized-for-cloud-tpus/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/google-open-sources-ai-image-segmentation-models-optimized-for-cloud-tpus/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1561234087356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHioCygz0CFlEaUBfWGKcL22fXRNA">custom</a> Tensor Processing Unit chips) and Amazon (which has created <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/28/aws-launches-inferentia-ai-chip.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/28/aws-launches-inferentia-ai-chip.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1561234087356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwj25JFhY1lZBANPP9qo6ias58wQ">an AI chip</a> for its Echo smart speaker) are also creating their own architectures.</p>
<p>Finally, we have our proliferation of connected gadgets, also known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Many of our personal and home tools (such as thermostats, smoke detectors, toothbrushes and toasters) operate on ultra-low power.</p>
<p>The ARM processor, which is a family of CPUs, will be tasked for these roles. That’s because gadgets do not require computing complexity or a lot of power. The ARM architecture is perfectly designed for them. It’s made to handle smaller number of computing instructions, can operate at higher speeds (churning through many millions of instructions per second) and do it at a fraction of the power required for performing complex instructions. I even predict that ARM-based server microprocessors will finally become a reality in cloud data centers.</p>
<p>So with all the new work being done in silicon, we seem to be finally getting back to our original roots. I commend the entrepreneurs who are putting the silicon back into Silicon Valley. And I predict they will create new semiconductor giants.</p>

The company&#8217;s first product is Basis, a supplement that combines compounds designed to increase NAD levels and activate sirtuins, boosting cellular health and longevity.</p>
<p>In this conversation we discuss why precursor companies failed, including Cambridge-based Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which was bought for $720 million in 2008. Eric explains how Elysium is a platform-based company that will sell a host of products and diagnostics, why he believes direct to consumer is the best market strategy, and what the current user base looks like.

Eric gets into the importance of bringing academic rigor and peer review to the supplement category, how he plans to build consumer trust and ultimately pull it into the mainstream. He shares why he believes in open source research, how cellular senescence is a particular area of interest right now, what his personal health routine is and how he thinks about the singularity.</p>

I’ll start with my scientific co-founder, Leonard Guarente. Leonard’s run the biology of aging Lab at MIT for the last 25 to 30 years. I didn’t set out to become an entrepreneur.

What’s interesting about this company is they were studying processes of aging and they identified one in particular. It was a class of genes that we now affectionately refer to as longevity genes. They’re called sirtuins. What they identified was that these genes are found in every living thing and that the activity level of these genes decreases through the normal course of aging. And when they reactivated these genes they saw amazing benefits, regardless of which model or organism you were looking at. They would live to the human equivalent of 120 years old. They don’t get cancer. They don’t gain weight.</p>

Life is pretty good at this point if you’re a mouse. It was a monumental discovery in terms of aging research and it got the researchers nominated for the Nobel Prize. One of the researchers involved in that series of discoveries in the late 90s early 2000s went off to Harvard to open his own lab. And being more risk-seeking he was screening for natural molecules that could potentially activate these genes. The hypothesis there, which has since carried over to Elysium, is that aging itself isn’t a disease. It’s about the interconnected degradation or failure of our own biological processes and metabolisms. There is a prevailing hypothesis we are seeing develop that natural compounds will be the most effective interventions. That was the approach taken there, and the researcher’s name is David Sinclair. He screened natural product libraries for potential hits that could activate these genes.</p>

Some people have heard of this. If you look back at the ‘04 ‘05 time frame there was a massive spike in red wine sales due to all the media coverage around it. So they started a company, Sirtris. So they make you the protagonist in this case study, and you have to make a decision as the management of the company. What was interesting was that you have a natural product and that aging isn’t a disease. To try and create a traditional pharmaceutical company and go after diseases you’d be trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. You’d likely have to modify the molecule, you would have to start looking at disease models. On the other hand, you could build a direct to consumer company, where you don’t have to modify the molecule, and aging isn’t a disease so you don’t have to go through a laborious long-term and huge cost effort from an approval standpoint. We debated the merits of both of these business models. I was firmly in the camp of the consumer facing effort, because I was reading this research and saying, how could anybody sitting in this room not want this for themselves or their parents or their friends?</p>

It’s something that we can now quantify and measure and potentially intervene. That was new to me, the fact that people at MIT and Harvard were studying this and making progress. So I left that fascinated. Shortly thereafter I reached out directly to the the the MIT professor who was the original discoverer of these genes, the sirtuins. I reached out to the scientific co-founder at Harvard. The question I had was, whatever happened to this? Because now it’s almost a decade since the acquisition. There had been little news on it.

Dr. Guarente. Or Lenny as we call him. Lenny and I just started off with conversations around how the research had progressed. At one point Lenny called me and said, “I’ve been approached by a Japanese venture capitalist who has invested in a company in Taiwan. They believe they have a potent sirtuin activating compound that’s very different from the resveratrol molecule.” He said, “I know nothing about the business side of things. We’re dealing with a venture capitalist and you’re a venture capitalist.” I was at the time — before business school I was at Bain Capital Ventures, after I was at Sequoia. He said, “would you want to go with me to look at this potential molecule?”</p>

This was late 2012. We met in San Francisco International Airport and went to Taiwan for a few days. It was a fascinating experience. We ultimately passed on that molecule despite some interesting research. But it was through that that Lenny and I came up with this idea that you could build a direct to consumer facing effort and that there would be more of these types of products, that it wasn’t limited to a single product idea. So this was the vision for creating a platform-based company.</p>

One of the things that Lenny and his constituencies in the research community had identified was that sirtuins are dependent on a coenzyme called NAD. We didn’t know that at the time that Sirtris was founded. It’s the production of NAD  —  a coenzyme, a fuel that’s used in a variety of reactions at the metabolic level  —  it was actually the production of this coenzyme that was decreasing in all of these living things. So NAD itself is not new. We’ve known about it for a hundred years. Two Nobel prizes have been awarded for elucidating its function. It’s important for things like DNA maintenance and repair, the creation of energy, the way the cells communicate both internally and with one another. Without NAD you’d be dead in under a minute. It’s very important. So this idea that it was decreasing, which we didn’t know until 2012, was a monumental discovery.</p>

If you could choose one food for the rest of your life my recommendation would be blueberries. Some people would disagree with me. Maybe it’s wine. But that was the idea behind Basis. First we need to restore levels of NAD. Secondly we can then go in and activate these longevity genes. And that there would be a synergy associated with that. The best way to think about it would be sports cars. If you’re activating sirtuins it’s like putting a turbo in the engine, but the car still requires some energy source. So if there’s no gasoline, or if you own a Tesla and there’s no battery power, it’s not going to work. But once you have the two of them together there’s a supercar.</p>

So for example, one of the areas we’re interested in is something called acute kidney injury. Thirty percent of people who go in for cardiovascular surgery will develop acute kidney injury, and with too much of it you’ll get kidney failure and dialysis. In 2004 there were just shy of a million cases in the United States of acute kidney injury. In 2014 just 10 years later there were four million cases. It’s not that our surgical techniques changed, it’s that older people are going in for these surgeries more often because our healthcare system is actually getting better. So we’re going to have to deal with these things. Two, from a diagnostic standpoint we are moving  —  out of necessity, at the research level  —  into an area where we’re now able to quantify aging. As an example there is an epigenetic test, a cheek swab or a spit tube type test, developed at UCLA in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health. It can basically tell you your biological age. The age on your passport or your driver’s license is your chronological age. But there’s something that the gene activity expression data we collect can tell you about how you are aging.</p>

Think of it as rings of a tree. Over time you can get a pretty accurate understanding of a single tree. How old is it. Did it go through a bountiful spring or a terrible winter. Was there a forest fire. That’s at the individual level. Then when you look at the macro level, at the forest, you can learn a lot about that particular ecosystem. It’s an oversimplification of the idea but it’s the same thing every time, looking at something called methylation. Every time one of these sites is methylated it leaves a mark. So we can quantify that and say does this intervention or product reverse, slow, or stop the aging process.</p>

As we move towards aging, we would argue that it should be classified as a disease. But today it’s difficult because it’s not a moment in time diagnosis. It’s not like one day you wake up feeling symptoms and you go to the doctor and he says, “yes we ran the tests and you have aging.” It’s a decades long accumulation of mutations and failures and other things. So these types of diagnostics have been developed by the research community out of necessity. They need to understand does this intervention actually slow, stop, or reverse aging. That’s just one measure. We’re going to see other diagnostics that take shape and form over the next several years. So to your point, that’s important for us. Because one, the conversation today has been around, OK if you can reverse this fundamental process of aging what does it mean for me? It’s one thing to say, the models that exist today could show efficacy in cancer or neurodegenerative diseases et cetera. But there’s been nothing between showing the reversal of that process and the outcome of it from a disease standpoint. So this idea that there’s a middle ground, something where you can say, well the speed at which you’re aging has changed for the better. That is an important step in the entire process.</p>

Moving beyond that requires us to prove more digestible and accessible points of understanding. This idea of rate of aging is a step in that direction. We’re also, as an example, doing a study on photo aging of the skin based on both the existing body of literature that’s out there as well as feedback we’ve had from customers. The conversation changes a lot if I can put you under a special camera that shows the UV damage to your skin and then shows you the before and after of someone who has taken the product for six months and how it changed them. Even just showing wrinkles and things like that. Things that people are used to, from a marketing standpoint, but they might not actually see the science in it today. So there is that evolution. The evolution from, yes we can reverse this fundamental process of aging to, well what does that mean for me?

We’re focused on healthspan first and foremost. If you go into a room of people, and we do this all the time, and you say to the audience, “We’re going to take a quick poll. How many of you want to live forever? How many of you want to live to 120 or 150? How many of you want to live to 80?” It’s interesting to see the distribution. If you then say, “you are going to live to that age but you’re going to be as healthy as you are today, would you change your answer?” Most people do. So we are first and foremost focused on quality of life and healthspan. The belief is, ultimately if you improve every day, that you’ll have more days on the back end.</p>

Hiring with the rigor that you would see in life sciences on the pharma side, into the consumer market. This is part of the shift. We will see legitimate companies not just Elysium, but others in the consumer sphere, changing this conversation.

In a one month span. Then that was sustained over a period of time after that. And it was done safely. But if a traditional pharmaceutical company had done that study they would have just internally validated that the product works, then continued their research. We chose to publish and announce it. What we found was an influx of research interest from MDs and PHDs all around the world who said, “I’m interested in NAD repletion or sirtuin activation, and I now know that your product can safely and sustainably reverse this decline. Would you be willing to work on this particular health problem with me?” So a lot of it we do internally. And a lot of it is also driven by the scientific advisory board or collaborators that approach us and say we’d love to do something with you.

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With all of the progress we&#8217;ve seen in deep learning tech in the past few years, it seems pretty inevitable that security cameras become smarter and more capable in regards to tracking, but there are more options than we think in how we choose to pull this off.</p>
<p><a href="https://traces.ai/">Traces AI</a> is a new computer vision startup, in Y Combinator&#8217;s latest batch of bets, that&#8217;s focused on helping cameras track people without relying on facial recognition data, something the founders believe is too invasive of the public&#8217;s privacy. The startup&#8217;s technology actually blurs out all human faces in frame, only relying on the other physical attributes of a person.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a combination of different parameters from the visuals. We can use your hair style, whether you have a backpack, your type of shoes and the combination of your clothing,&#8221; co-founder <span class="jsx-4241397600 fromInner"><span class="jsx-1092672385 base"><span class="jsx-1092672385 name">Veronika Yurchuk tells TechCrunch.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Tech like this obviously doesn&#8217;t scale too well for a multi-day city-wide manhunt, and leaves room for some Jason Bourne-esque criminals to turn their jackets inside out and toss on a baseball cap to evade detection. As a potential customer, why forego a sophisticated technology just to stave off dystopia? Well, Traces AI isn&#8217;t so convinced that facial recognition tech is always the best solution; they believe that facial tracking isn&#8217;t something every customer wants or needs and there should be more variety in terms of solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest concern [detractors] have is, &#8216;Okay, you want to ban the technology that is actually protecting people today, and will be protecting this country tomorrow?&#8217; And, that&#8217;s hard to argue with, but what we are actually trying to do is propose an alternative that will be very effective but less invasive of privacy,&#8221; co-founder Kostya Shysh tells me.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, San Francisco banned government agencies from the use of facial recognition software, and it&#8217;s unlikely that they will be the only city to make that choice. In our conversation, Shysh also highlighted<a href="https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/detroits-facial-recognition-technology-provokes-backlash-proposed-bans/Content?oid=22272625"> some of the backlash</a> to Detroit&#8217;s Project Green Light, which brought facial recognition surveillance tech city-wide.</p>
<p>Traces AI&#8217;s solution can also be a better option for closed venues that have limited data on the people on their premises in the first place. One use case Shysh highlighted was being able to find a lost child in an amusement park with just a little data.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can actually give them a verbal description, so if you say, &#8216;it&#8217;s a missing 10-year-old boy, and he had blue shorts and a white t shirt,&#8217; that will be enough information for us to start a search,&#8221; Shysh says.</p>
<p>In addition to being a better way to promote privacy, Shysh also sees the technology as a more effective way to reduce the racial bias of these computer vision systems that have proven less adept at distinguishing non-white faces, and are thus often more prone to false positives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way our technology works, we actually blur faces of the people before sending it to the cloud. We&#8217;re doing it intentionally as one of the safety mechanisms to protect from racial and gender biases as well,&#8221; Shysh says.</p>
<p>The co-founders say that the U.S. and Great Britain are likely going to be their biggest markets due to the high quantity of CCTV cameras, but they&#8217;re also pursuing customers in Asian countries like Japan and Singapore, where face-obscuring facial masks are often worn and can leave facial tracking software much less effective.</p>

Russinovich, who will join us for a fireside chat at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-enterprise-2019?utm_medium=post33&amp;utm_campaign=enterprise_2019&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;unii-trigger-open=C8ZPQF&amp;ref=post33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechCrunch Sessions: Enterprise</a> event in San Francisco on September 5 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-enterprise-2019?utm_medium=post33&amp;utm_campaign=enterprise_2019&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;unii-trigger-open=C8ZPQF&amp;ref=post33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p.s. early-bird sale ends Friday</a>), is also an accomplished novelist who has published <a href="http://www.trojanhorsethebook.com/books/">four novels</a>, all of which center around tech and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>At our event, though, we won&#8217;t focus on his literary accomplishments (except for maybe his books <a href="http://www.trojanhorsethebook.com/books/windows-internals-6/">about Windows Server</a>) as much as on the trends he&#8217;s seeing in enterprise cloud adoption. Microsoft, maybe more so than its competitors, always made enterprise customers and their needs the focus of its cloud initiatives from the outset. Today, as the majority of enterprises is looking to move at least some of their legacy workloads into the cloud, they are often stumped by the sheer complexity of that undertaking.</p>
<p>In our fireside chat, we&#8217;ll talk about what <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is doing to reduce this complexity and how enterprises can maximize their current investments into the cloud, both for running new cloud-native applications and for bringing legacy applications into the future. We&#8217;ll also talk about new technologies that can make the move to the cloud more attractive to enterprises, including the current buzz around edge computing, IoT, AI and more.</p>
<p>Before joining <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Russinovich, who has a Ph.D. in computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon, was the co-founder and chief architect of Winternals Software, which Microsoft <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/microsoft-buys-winternals-software-562412/">acquired in 2006</a>. During his time at Winternals, Russinovich discovered the <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/markrussinovich/2005/10/31/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights-management-gone-too-far/">infamous Sony rootkit</a>. Over his 13 years at Microsoft, he moved from Technical Fellow up to the CTO position for Azure, which continues to grow at a rapid clip as it looks to challenge AWS&#8217;s leadership in total cloud revenue.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Friday, August 16 is your <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-enterprise-2019?utm_medium=post33&amp;utm_campaign=enterprise_2019&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;unii-trigger-open=C8ZPQF&amp;ref=post33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last day to save $100</a> on tickets before prices go up. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-enterprise-2019?utm_medium=post33&amp;utm_campaign=enterprise_2019&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;unii-trigger-open=C8ZPQF&amp;ref=post33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book your early-bird tickets now</a> and keep that Benjamin in your pocket.</p>

<p>The change comes after a recent Motherboard <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xweqbq/microsoft-contractors-listen-to-skype-calls">report</a> that contractors were listening to personal Skype conversations and Cortana audio recordings. Microsoft is just the latest tech giant to get called out for failing to make it clear that human contractors could be listening to users&#8217; audio recordings.</p>
<p>When asked about the policy changes, the company said, &#8220;We realized, based on questions raised recently, that we could do a better job specifying that humans sometimes review this content.”</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After 18 years at the helm, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mitchell-reichgut" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mitchell-reichgut">Mitchell Reichgut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is stepping down as CEO of <a href="https://www.jungroup.com/brands">Jun Group</a>, with COO and president Corey Weiner taking over as chief executive.</p>
<p>The news comes just about a year after <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jun-group" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jun-group">Jun Group <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was acquired by <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/10/jun-group-acquired-advantage-solutions-refine-firm-s-retail-solutions">Advantage Solutions</a>, but Reichgut said the acquisition was a &#8220;non-factor&#8221; in his decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is the right time for the company to have a leadership change,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have been stepping back more and more, so it&#8217;s a natural progression, with a bunch of managers here taking on larger roles as I move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Weiner (who&#8217;s been at Jun Group since 2003), other Jun Group executives taking on new roles include Mishel Alon becoming COO, Leslie Bargmann becoming vice president of client services and Jeremy Ellison becoming vice president of technology.</p>
<p>Reichgut, meanwhile, said he&#8217;s &#8220;stepping back entirely to focus on artwork and writing and community service after a long, long career.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Weiner plans to double down on Jun Group&#8217;s approach to advertising, where it builds custom audience segments by polling users in its network, then shows video ads and branded content to interested viewers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our primary motivation is to evangelize that format,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As you know, most advertising is interruptive and consumers don&#8217;t like that kind of advertising very much — in some cases, they&#8217;re annoyed by it. This value exchange flips the advertising paradigm on its head. By choosing to engage with advertising, they are getting something amazing in return.&#8221;</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The right people to solve the trillion-dollar student debt crisis might be the ones who are suffering from it the hardest.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a recent college graduate, there&#8217;s a 50% chance you took on debt when you moved off campus. If you&#8217;re like the average student borrower, you graduated with $29,800 of loan debt, and are making a monthly re-payment of between $200 and $300, <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/hhdc_2019q2.pdf">according to a recent report from the New York Fed.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gradjoy-student-loan-copilot/id1469022274">GradJoy</a> is a new Y Combinator-backed startup that wants to help the <a href="https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/">45 million student debt borrowers in the U.S. </a>manage their repayment plans. Within seven days of being a live platform and a marketing strategy that consisted of reaching out to a few universities, GradJoy is already managing $20 million in loans.</p>
<p>Co-founders Jose Bethancourt and Marco del Carmen turned down roles at Cloudflare and MongoDB, respectively, upon learning they&#8217;d been accepted to Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2019 class. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gradjoy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gradjoy">GradJoy <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> bills itself as a &#8220;student loan co-pilot,&#8221; and currently exists as a platform that helps users manage student loan repayments &#8212; whether that&#8217;s assessing pros and cons of refinancing, what a monthly payment should look like and if they have any wiggle room based on greater income and spending habits. GradJoy hopes to hammer a few cracks in the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-postsecondary/reports/2019/06/12/470893/addressing-1-5-trillion-federal-student-loan-debt/">$1.5 trillion federal student loan debt crisis</a> by giving new borrowers more insight into their repayment journey.</p>
<p>Loan companies will always advise borrowers to pay the minimum because they benefit from the outrageous interest fees amassed over time. GradJoy wants to tap into your bank account and monitor your finances to deliver more transparent loan-management advice with a feature that lets you simulate how different payment amounts would affect your loans.</p>
<p>Bethancourt, a recent University of Texas graduate, was his own first user. He built the GradJoy platform for himself while calculating his optimal student loan repayment plan in Excel. He&#8217;d met his co-founder in a coding bootcamp in the Rio Grande Valley at the border of Mexico and South Texas &#8212; where Bethancourt is originally from.</p>

<p>Student lending is a predatory industry that benefits off the ignorance of first-time borrowers and has been known to purposefully constrict resources for customers. New borrowers must navigate landmines like refinancing scams, the &#8220;7-minute rule&#8221; for customer service assistance and tricky requirements buried within the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2019/08/13/what-its-like-to-apply-for-public-service-loan-forgiveness/#176bac3e3612">public service loan forgiveness program.</a></p>
<p>A question is posed for new startups that want to punch up against greedy student loan servicers like Navient and AES. Without replicating the corrupt business models that lenders have in order to make money off the student loan debt problem, how can newcomers like GradJoy become profitable?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1868800" style="width: 995px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1868800" class="breakout wp-image-1868800 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-14-at-1.02.11-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 08 14 at 1.02.11 PM" width="985" height="531" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-14-at-1.02.11-PM.png 985w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-14-at-1.02.11-PM.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-14-at-1.02.11-PM.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-14-at-1.02.11-PM.png?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-14-at-1.02.11-PM.png?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-14-at-1.02.11-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1868800" class="wp-caption-text">Gradjoy bills itself as a &#8220;student loan co-pilot&#8221;</p></div></p>
<p>Aside from venture capital, which GradJoy will be seeking upon its graduation from Y Combinator, it will make money in a few ways. In order to align with users&#8217; goals, GradJoy&#8217;s business model is tied to their savings. If a user refinances using GradJoy, they get a referral payment from their lending partners. The platform is currently beta testing their robo-advisor for debt, and in the future they plan on charging a small fee per month if they&#8217;re able to save a user money.</p>
<p>Student loans don&#8217;t only burden millennial bank accounts. The student loan debt crisis is creating an economic trend. Inability to repay student loans causes young people to rely on credit cards to make ends meet and delay major life choices like investing in property. Not to mention the affect of student debt on mental health for young people at an already volatile point in their lives.</p>
<p>In five years, GradJoy&#8217;s founders say they&#8217;d like to be running a more robust financial services product that was first focused on helping its customers pay off student loans. They hope to mobilize customers while they&#8217;re at the nascence of their financial independence, and scale up to launch a larger suite of financial service products.</p>

<p>And for scooter startups, city regulations can make or break their businesses across nearly every aspect of operations, especially two major ones: ridership growth and ability to attract investor dollars. From issuing permits to determining how many scooters any one company can operate at any one time to enforcing low-income plans and impacting product roadmaps, the ball is really in the city&#8217;s court.</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. Cyber Command, the sister division of the National Security Agency focused on offensive hacking and security operations, has released a set of <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/93e13ffd2a2f1a13fb9a09de1d98324f75b3f0f8e0c822857ed5ca3b73ee3672/detection">new</a> <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7cf5d86cc75cd8f0e22e35213a9c051b740bd4667d9879a446f06277782bffd1/detection">samples</a> of malware linked to North Korean hackers.</p>
<p>The military unit tweeted Wednesday that <a href="https://twitter.com/CNMF_VirusAlert/status/1161727314658562048">it had uploaded the malware</a> to VirusTotal, a widely used database for malware and security research.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time the unit has uploaded malware to the server — it has its <a href="https://twitter.com/CNMF_VirusAlert">own Twitter account</a> to tell followers which malware it uploads. On one hand the disclosure helps security teams fight threats from nation states, but it also gives a rare glimpse inside the nation state-backed hacking groups on which Cyber Command is focused.</p>
<p>The uploaded malware sample is named <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR19-129A">Electric Fish</a> by the U.S. government. Electric Fish is a tunneling tool designed to exfiltrate data from one system to another over the internet once a backdoor has been placed.</p>
<p>Electric Fish is linked to the APT38 hacking group.</p>
<p>FireEye says APT38 has distinctly different motivations from other North Korean-backed hacking groups like Lazarus, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/03/north-korea-lazarus-hackers/">was blamed</a> for the Sony hack in 2016 and the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017. APT38 is focused on financial crimes, such as <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/10/apt38-details-on-new-north-korean-regime-backed-threat-group.html">stealing millions of dollars</a> from banks across the world, the cybersecurity firm said.</p>
<p>Electric Fish was first discovered in May, according to Homeland Security&#8217;s cybersecurity division CISA, but APT38 has been active for several years.</p>
<p>A recently leaked United Nations report said the North Korean regime has <a href="https://apnews.com/ece1c6b122224bd9ac5e4cbd0c1e1d80">stolen more than $2 billion</a> through dozens of cyberattacks to fund its various weapons programs.</p>
<p>APT38 has amassed more than $100 million in stolen funds since its inception.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this article misidentified the North Korean threat group as APT36. The group is APT38.</em></p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/plex" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="plex">Plex <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today is launching a new <a href="https://www.plex.tv/downloads/#plex-app">desktop application for Mac and Windows</a>, with the goal of eventually replacing Plex Media Player as the company&#8217;s only desktop solution. The app&#8217;s arrival also signals a change in direction for the company, which will also now remove its existing Windows Store application and end support for the traditional home theater PC setup &#8212; the latter which involves a desktop computer connected to a TV or home theater.</p>
<p>The company explains this decision was made after examining how people were using Plex today, and found that most would have an equal or even better experience with a streaming device and its new players.</p>
<p>&#8220;It marks the end of an era for us, and we’d be lying if we said it wasn’t a little bittersweet,&#8221; the company wrote in a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/desktop-af/">blog post</a> about the change.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1869301" title="plex-desktop-tidal-recommended-1024x661" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-recommended-1024x661.jpg?w=680" alt="plex desktop tidal recommended 1024x661" width="680" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-recommended-1024x661.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-recommended-1024x661.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-recommended-1024x661.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-recommended-1024x661.jpg?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-recommended-1024x661.jpg?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-recommended-1024x661.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Home theater PC-style configurations are today a bit of a holdover from an earlier era where there were fewer resources to stream personal media from your PC to your TV. Today, however, Plex&#8217;s apps for streaming devices are fairly capable, and a heck of a lot simpler to set up and use by mainstream consumers.</p>
<p>The company also noted that the new Apple TV and Android players support nearly all the same formats and that Plex&#8217;s app for streaming devices has come a long way in recent years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1869299" title="plex-desktop-tidal-artist-1024x660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-artist-1024x660.jpg?w=680" alt="plex desktop tidal artist 1024x660" width="680" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-artist-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-artist-1024x660.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-artist-1024x660.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-artist-1024x660.jpg?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-artist-1024x660.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/plex-desktop-tidal-artist-1024x660.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Modern streaming devices don’t need as much care and feeding as desktop computers. They don’t need to sleep (much), they use a tiny amount of electricity&#8230;and they don’t require nearly as much effort to get up and running. They have remotes that work wonderfully out of the box (no more fiddly custom key mappings!) In short, they’re designed for the environment in which you’re using them, and it shows,&#8221; the company explained, in hopes of fending off any backlash.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new Plex desktop app includes all the capabilities of Plex Media Player along with support for offline access. Previously called &#8220;Sync,&#8221; this feature has been renamed to &#8220;Downloads,&#8221; and lets you take your media with you. Similar support for offline media will come to Plex&#8217;s mobile apps, too, at a later date, the company said.</p>
<p>To use the Downloads feature, you&#8217;ll need a Plex Pass subscription. But otherwise, the new desktop app is free.</p>
<p>Though the desktop app is meant to replace Plex Media Player, the company says it will <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/plex-media-player/120475/last">continue to update the software</a> until January 2020, to allow time for everyone to make the transition.</p>
<p>Plex&#8217;s overall business has been changing, in recent years, to become more than just a home media organizer. Today, Plex is a DIY streaming solution that allows users to watch not just their own media across platforms, but also stream <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/plex-adds-support-for-podcasts-debuts-personalized-mobile-apps/">podcasts</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/plex-adds-personalized-streaming-news-to-its-media-player-software/">news</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/in-a-quest-to-centralize-all-your-media-plex-now-includes-web-series/">web series</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/plex-teams-with-tidal-to-bring-a-discounted-streaming-music-subscription-to-its-media-app/">music from TIDAL</a>, as well as capture and record <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/plex-becomes-a-low-cost-diy-streaming-tv-service/">live TV</a> from a digital antenna.</p>
<p>This change has led to other closures, including Plex&#8217;s decision last year to shutter Plugins, Cloud Sync and its “Watch Later” bookmarking feature, in addition to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/plex-cloud-will-shut-down-november-30-due-to-technical-challenges/">technically challenging</a> Plex Cloud.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how successful Plex&#8217;s changes have been as the company doesn&#8217;t disclose its number of paying subscribers. However, last year, Plex said it had 15 million registered users &#8212; meaning both free and paid. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/plex-studio-talks-avod-svod-1203102499/">In January 2019, it upped that number to 20 million</a> and noted it had &#8220;millions&#8221; of people using Plex on a monthly basis.</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/north-america-wearables-q2-2019?ctid=454-555e4b6bd0b38075ae924787b9c235e9">numbers out of Canalys</a> show strong continued growth for the North America wearables market for Q2. The market hit $2 billion value for the quarter, according to the firm, marking a 38% year over year growth.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly earth-shattering, but it’s steady for a category that felt almost dead in the water a year or two back. Growth for the quarter was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Samsung, which marked 32% and 121% growth, coming in at first and third place, respectively &#8212; at 2.2 million and 400,000 units.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitbit">Fitbit, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> meanwhile, retained its No. 2 position. The company showed a modest 18% growth, owing the slowdown to fewer smartwatches (versus fitness bands) shipped. That tracks with the company’s disappointing quarterly results as the new Versa Lite failed to hit the mark. The move marks a misstep for the Versa brand, which has otherwise contributed well to Fitbit&#8217;s bounce back.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1869283" title="unnamed (1)" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-1.png" alt="unnamed 1" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-1.png 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-1.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unnamed-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, while North America is the No. 2 wearables market in terms of units shipped, it continues to be the most valuable. That’s likely due to higher unit prices, with the Apple Watch leading the pack, versus Xiaomi’s super-cheap fitness bands, which have a much stronger foothold in their native China.</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For a couple of years now <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-galactic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-galactic">Virgin Galactic&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Spaceport America was more aspirational than functional, but now it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-opens-the-doors-to-the-gateway-to-space/">built out with the necessaries</a> for commercial spaceflight — mainly coffee. The company just showed off the newly redesigned space from which it plans to launch flights&#8230; sometime.</p>
<p>Much of the undulating, aesthetically rusted building, located deep in the desert of New Mexico, is dedicated to housing the carrier craft and rocket planes that the company has been testing for the last few years.</p>
<p>That was almost certainly the hard part, in fact: relocating the infrastructure necessary to support the spacefaring vehicles, including engineers, equipment and supply chain people, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/virgin-galactic-is-coming-home-to-spaceport-america-in-new-mexico/">as Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides told me in May</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RxKRaFa2IF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/virgin-galactic-is-coming-home-to-spaceport-america-in-new-mexico/">Virgin Galactic is &#8216;coming home&#8217; to Spaceport America in New Mexico</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;Virgin Galactic is &#8216;coming home&#8217; to Spaceport America in New Mexico&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/virgin-galactic-is-coming-home-to-spaceport-america-in-new-mexico/embed/#?secret=RxKRaFa2IF" data-secret="RxKRaFa2IF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the spaceport itself must also become a place for humans to arrive, park at, nervously sip coffee and have a pre-flight meal — if that&#8217;s really a good idea for your first trip to space. Maybe stick to coffee.</p>
<p>The &#8220;first phase&#8221; of the consumer-side build-out includes an elegantly appointed little restaurant and cafe, and upstairs can be found &#8220;mission control,&#8221; which looks more like a conference room than a spaceplane pilot staging area.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="1869269,1869273,1869279,1869270,1869266,1869277,1869271"]</p>
<p>There are a number of little lounge areas for passengers and others to congregate in, and if the scale seems a little small, keep in mind that this isn&#8217;t an airport food court. These flights are going to be full, but they&#8217;re also going to be six passengers at a time.</p>
<p>Jeremy Brown, design director for Spaceport America, explains that the choice of materials and terraced surfaces, leading up to the lighter, airier second story, is meant to evoke the landscape outside, which nearly all the seating faces, and draw the attention outwards and upwards.</p>
<p>Although Virgin Galactic has had several <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/virgin-galactic-touches-the-edge-of-space-with-mach-2-9-test-flight-of-spaceshiptwo/">successful test flights</a>, there&#8217;s no indication when its first actual commercial flight will be.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last flight we did, we basically demonstrated a full commercial profile, including the interior of the vehicle,” Whitesides said in May. “Not only did we, you know, go up to space and come down, but because Beth was in the back — Beth Moses, our flight instructor — she was sort of our mock passenger. She got up a couple times and moved around, she was able to verify our cabin conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The paperwork is in order and the spaceport itself is now equipped with a cafe, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw the first flight from Virgin Galactic before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Now a blockchain startup thinks it may have the making of one solution, rewarding us with crypto tokens for making the right choices for the planet. Now, before you roll your eyes, hear me out&#8230;</p>
<p>Imagine rewarding people for taking the bus instead of their car &#8212; and them exchanging that token to offset their carbon by planting a tree? Or incentivizing passengers for sharing their travel data &#8212; helping companies to improve their experience in the future? That&#8217;s the big idea here.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: The <a href="http://www.dovu.io/">DOVU platform</a> offers a token, wallet and marketplace and allows users to earn tokens and spend them to carbon-offset their activity and on rewards within the mobility ecosystem, starting with their Uber rides.</p>
<p>Users link their Uber account to their <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dovu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dovu">DOVU <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wallet, enabling them to earn DOV tokens for every journey taken. The startup has connected to Uber APIs, meaning that, once authenticated, the user has to do nothing other than take the journey.</p>
<p>The DOVU CO2 calculator then automatically rewards the value of tokens depending on the length of the journey. The DOV tokens can then be spent within the DOVU Action, and the user can choose the project to back or the user can ask DOVU to choose the project on their behalf to ensure the carbon offsetting happens.</p>
<p>The platform can connect to any published API, meaning it is in a notional position to have an immediate impact on all the new mobility solutions globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/jaguar-land-rover-is-backing-dovu-to-bring-the-blockchain-to-the-mobile-future/">With Jaguar Land Rover as shareholders</a>, DOVU potentially has the backing to try to make this happen.</p>
<p>Mobility-related organizations often have a need to reward, incentivize or nudge their users to do the right thing. It might be sharing their data for better service planning, taking an alternate route to help ease traffic congestion or charging electric batteries at times that are best for the grid. Whether it’s influencing consumer behavior or encouraging data sharing, the DOVU platform could, in theory, provide a solution that meets the needs of both the mobility provider and the end user. That at least is their pitch.</p>
<p>Hell, given the state of the planet, it might be worth a shot&#8230;</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Networking and web security giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cloudflare">Cloudflare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says the recent 8chan controversy may be an ongoing &#8220;risk factor&#8221; for its business on the back of its upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/cloudflare-files-for-initial-public-offering/">initial public offering</a>.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/16/cloudflare-ceo-matthew-prince-on-beating-disrupt-battlefield-nerves-and-avoiding-site-meltdowns/">former Battlefield finalist</a>, which filed its IPO paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, earlier this month took <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/04/cloudflare-will-stop-service-to-8chan-which-ceo-matthew-prince-describes-as-a-cesspool-of-hate/">the rare step of pulling the plug</a> on one of its customers, 8chan, an anonymous message board linked to recent domestic terrorist attacks in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, which killed 31 people. The site is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/17/facebook-new-zealand/">linked to the shootings</a> in New Zealand, which killed 50 people.</p>
<p>8chan became the second customer to have its service cut off by Cloudflare in the aftermath of the attacks. The first and other time Cloudflare booted one of its customers was neo-Nazi website <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/20/the-daily-stormer-was-back-online-for-a-quick-second/">The Daily Stormer in 2017</a>, after it claimed the networking giant was secretly supportive of the website.</p>
<p>Cloudflare, which provides web security and denial-of-service protection for websites, recognizes those customer cut-offs as a risk factor for investors buying shares in the company&#8217;s common stock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Activities of our paying and free customers or the content of their websites and other Internet properties could cause us to experience significant adverse political, business, and reputational consequences with customers, employees, suppliers, government entities, and other third parties,&#8221; <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477333/000119312519222176/d735023ds1.htm">the filing said</a>. &#8220;Even if we comply with legal obligations to remove or disable customer content, we may maintain relationships with customers that others find hostile, offensive, or inappropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cloudflare had long taken a stance of not policing who it provides service to, citing freedom of speech. In <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-cloudflare-monster-erotica-tough-lesson-in-censorship/">a 2015 interview</a> with ZDNet, chief executive Matthew Prince said he didn&#8217;t ever want to be in a position where he was making &#8220;moral judgments on what&#8217;s good and bad,&#8221; and would instead defer to the courts.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a final court order comes down and says we can&#8217;t do something&#8230; governments have tanks and guns,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But since Prince changed his stance on both The Daily Stormer and 8chan, the company recognized it &#8220;experienced significant negative publicity&#8221; in the aftermath.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are aware of some potential customers that have indicated their decision to not subscribe to our products was impacted, at least in part, by the actions of certain of our paying and free customers,&#8221; said the filing. &#8220;We may also experience other adverse political, business and reputational consequences with prospective and current customers, employees, suppliers, and others related to the activities of our paying and free customers, especially if such hostile, offensive, or inappropriate use is high profile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cloudflare has also come under fire <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cloudflare-cybersecurity-terrorist-groups_us_5c127778e4b0835fe3277f2f?tzs">in recent months</a> for allegedly supplying web protection services to sites that promote and support terrorism, including al-Shabaab and the Taliban, both of which are covered under U.S. Treasury sanctions.</p>
<p>In response, the company said it tries &#8220;to be neutral,&#8221; but wouldn&#8217;t comment specifically on the matter.</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">After much <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cloudflare-plans-to-ipo-in-september-2019-7">speculation</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/terminating-service-for-8chan/">no small amount of controversy</a>, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, one of the companies that ensures that websites run smoothly on the internet, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477333/000119312519222176/d735023ds1.htm">has filed for its initial public offering</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>The company, which made its debut on TechCrunch&#8217;s Battlefield stage back in 2010, has put a placeholder value of the offering at $100 million, but it will likely be worth billions when it finally trades on the market.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cloudflare">Cloudflare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is one of a clutch of businesses whose job it is to make web sites run better, faster and with little to no downtime.</p>
<p>Recently the company has been at the center of political debates around some of the customers and company it keeps, including social media networks like 8chan and<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/"> racist media companies like the Daily Stormer</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the company went so far as to cite 8chan as a risk factor in its public offering documents.</p>
<p>As far as money goes, Cloudflare is &#8212; like other early-stage technology companies &#8212; losing money. But it&#8217;s not losing that much money, and its growth is impressive.</p>
<p>As the company notes in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have experienced significant growth, with our revenue increasing from $84.8 million in 2016 to $134.9 million in 2017 and to $192.7 million in 2018, increases of 59% and 43%, respectively. As we continue to invest in our business, we have incurred net losses of $17.3 million, $10.7 million, and $87.2 million for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, our revenue increased from $87.1 million to $129.2 million, an increase of 48%, and we incurred net losses of $32.5 million and $36.8 million, respectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cloudflare sits at the intersection of government policy and private company operations and its potential risk factors include a discussion about what that could mean for its business.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t the first network infrastructure service provider to hit the market. That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/19/fastly-the-content-delivery-network-files-for-an-ipo/">distinction belongs to Fastly</a>, whose shares likely have not performed as well as investors would have liked.</p>

<p>Cloudflare has raised roughly $332 million to date from investors, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/franklin-templeton-investments" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="franklin-templeton-investments">Franklin Templeton Investments, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Fidelity, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/union-square-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="union-square-ventures">Union Square Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> New Enterprise Associates, Pelion Venture Partners and Venrock. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cloudflare-plans-to-ipo-in-september-2019-7">Business Insider</a> reported that the company&#8217;s last investment gave Cloudflare a valuation of $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>The company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;NET.&#8221; Underwriters on the company&#8217;s public offering include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/goldman-sachs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="goldman-sachs">Goldman Sachs, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Jefferies, Wells Fargo Securities and RBC Capital Markets.</p>
